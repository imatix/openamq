<P>The SMT (Simple Multi-Threading kernel) from iMatix is an
add-on for the $(*lr=Libero) programming tool that lets you
write portable high-performance multithreaded programs based on
Libero's finite-state machine (FSM) design method.

<P>You may want to go straight to the $(*TOC=Table of Contents).
.if $(superdoc?0) == 0
Also, this documentation is available as <A HREF="smtdoc.htm">a
single file</A>, suitable for printing.

<P>To download SMT go to the $(*download="download page").
.endif

<P>You can use the SMT kernel for:
<UL>
<LI>Internet programming: where each connection is handled by one
thread.
<LI>Real-time programming: where multilevel finite-state machines
work cooperatively.
<LI>GUI development: where events are collected from the GUI and
passed to threads for processing.
</UL>

<P>The SMT kernel's main features are:
<UL>
<LI>100% portability.
<LI>Strong object orientation.
<LI>Support for multiple FSM programs within one application.

</UL>

<P>The SMT kernel currently supports C/C++, and is written in
portable ANSI C.  It uses the iMatix $(*sfl=SFL) (standard
function library) as a technical platform, and the $(*lr=Libero)
tool as development method.  Libero, the SFL, and the SMT kernel
are provided as free software, copyrighted by iMatix.  You may
freely incorporate the SFL and SMT packages in your applications
with a minimum of conditions.  Read the $(*license=SMT license)
agreement for details.

<P>To use the SMT kernel you should have used Libero and
understand the concepts involved.  SMT applications are
essentially written using Libero.  We assume that the reader has
some familiarity with Libero.

<P>The SMT kernel has been ported to MS-DOS, Windows, UNIX systems
(Linux, IBM AIX, SunOS, HP/UX) and should be portable to Digital
VMS.  It comes with complete sources and documentation in HTML.
It includes XITAMI, a portable multithreaded web server.

.page Introduction
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Origins</H3>

<P>SMT 2.0 is an evolution of SMT version 1.x of the iMatix SMT
kernel.  SMT 1.x was specifically designed for TCP/IP server
development.  SMT 2.x is a more generalised approach that makes
multithreaded FSMs suitable for a variety of purposes.  SMT 2.0 is
not backwards compatible with SMT 1.x, but it is quite
straight-forward to convert applications.

<P>The main objectives of SMT 1.0 were:
<OL>
<LI>Mulithreading - a cleaner and more efficient approach for
certain types of problems than alternatives such as
multiprocessing (forking) or iteration.
<LI>Simplicity - using the Libero method to simplify an otherwise
complex multithreaded model.
<LI>Portability - so that a SMT application runs on UNIX, Windows
95, Windows NT, and Digital VMS with similar functionality.
</OL>

<P>SMT 2.0 is meant to answer a wider set of issues. Specifically,
our goal was to provide multithreading capability in these domains:
<UL>
<LI>Internet servers
<LI>Other communication servers
<LI>Asynchronous FSM architectures
<LI>Internally multithreaded (batch) programs
<LI>GUI-based programs (e.g. Windows)
</UL>

<P>In SMT 1.x, external events were received and processed by a
kernel built-in to each SMT program.  The SMT 1.x kernel was
specifically designed to be driven by TCP/IP events.  An SMT 1.x
program is invoked, does its work, and finally terminates.  We
call this type of program a 'batch' program.  This is suitable for
servers ('daemons'), but not for real-time programs that must be
integrated into an large-scale event-driven architecture.

<P>SMT 2.x is designed as an event-passing kernel.  The
application consists of a number of agent programs, each running
one or more threads.  Each thread has an event queue.  Threads
send each other events, which are queued, and delivered by the
kernel to the state machine that controls each thread.  The SMT
kernel API lets you send and receive events, create threads, etc.
There are various ways to construct an agent program (single-
threaded, multithreaded), and different ways to handle event
queues (one thread per queue, or several threads per queue).
Agents and events can have priorities, which changes the order of
execution and delivery.

<P>SMT provides a number of standard agents that are easily reused
in applications.  For example, in an Internet application, the
socket i/o agent collects events from the Internet sockets used by
the application.  When a thread wants to read data from a socket,
it sends an event to the socket i/o agent, telling it which port,
and how much data.  The socket i/o agent reads the data and
returns that as a event.  Other standard agents are: a logging
agent to write log file data; an operator console agent to handle
error and warning events; a timer agent to generate alarm
events.<P>  <P>SMT also includes a number of protocol agents for
use in SMT applications: echo, HTTP, FTP.

<P>In SMT 1.x, external events such as TCP/IP events were
collected by the kernel, in SMT 2.x such events are collected by
an agent program.  Thus it is possible to add support to any
external event source.

<H3>Classic Multithreading Environments</H3>

<P>Multithreaded programming is often perceived as complicated.
When we look at multithreading facilities provided by existing
operating systems, we tend to agree. The most common type of
multithreading is <EM>pre-emptive multithreading</EM>.  This is
typically seen on UNIX and Windows NT systems.  The
characteristics of this approach are:
<UL>
<LI>The multithreading system (or operating system) switches
between threads arbitrarily.  This is 'pre-emptive'.
<LI>The thread program looks like standard procedural code.
<LI>Threads communicate using <EM>semaphores</EM>: when one thread
must wait for another, it sets a semaphore and then waits until
the second thread resets the semaphore.
<LI>Threads can access shared resources by using semaphores, or by
defining <EM>critical sections</EM>.  A critical section is a
block of code that executes entirely, without a thread
switch.
<LI>I/O is handled in critical sections.
</UL>

<P>A less common type of multithreading is <EM>cooperative
multithreading</EM>.  One example is the <EM>chained
multithreading</EM> method used on Digital VMS systems.  The
characteristics of this approach are:
<UL>
<LI>Each thread decides when to return control to the
multithreading system or operating system.
<LI>The thread program consists of a chain of small blocks of
code.
<LI>Threads can communicate using semaphores.
<LI>Threads can access shared resources at any time - threads
always execute as if in a critical section.
<LI>I/o is handled asynchronously: i/o operations are usually the
basic unit of logic in a thread.  Each block of code in a thread
requests an i/o operation, and specifies the successor block.
</UL>

<P>If we compare these methods, we can see advantages and
disadvantages in each:
<UL>
<LI>The chained method is much harder to program.
<LI>The chained method can produce much more efficient programs,
especially if they are i/o bound.
<LI>The pre-emptive method requires extra work to define critical
sections; it is not fail-safe.  By forgetting to define a critical
section, a program may work one day, then fail another time.  The
chained method does not require critical sections.
</UL>

<P>Both these methods are expensive to program, and can produce
code that is hard to maintain, error-prone, and therefore very
expensive to make robust enough for real applications.

<H3>The History Of Libero Multithreading</H3>

<P>In 1990, $(*leif=Leif Svalgaard) wrote a tiny multitasking
monitor for MS-DOS, to demonstrate that multitasking did not
require megabytes of memory.  This monitor was based on an
event-passing kernel.  It worked well and could multitask several
DOS sessions simply and efficiently.  This project was remarkable
because it took a very short time to write (one long weekend) and
because it required so little memory to run (several kilobytes).
This monitor was based on Leif Svalgaard's earlier work in
operating systems design, and defined the core principles of the
SMT 2.x kernel.

<P>In 1993, Pieter Hintjens developed a complex multithreaded
application using the Digital VMS chained multithreading method.
Under severe time constraints, he was obliged to take a radical
alternative to the normal approach.  He used Libero to abstract
the 'chain' of multithreaded logic.  This reduced the development
cost by an estimated 80%, and resulted in a very stable and
efficient application.  This experience showed that the Libero
state-machine abstraction - already useful for writing normal
procedural code - was also good in multithreaded applications.

<P>In 1993, Christian Rozet and Stephen Bidoul of ACSE built a
version of Libero that generated a C++ 'asynchronous finite-state
machine' to handle events coming from a GUI (MS-Windows).  The
resulting applications were in effect multithreaded applications,
with the multithreading handled by Libero (actually the code that
Libero generated).

<P>In 1995, Pieter Hintjens and Pascal Antonnaux built SMT version
1.0, and a set of demonstration programs.  The <EM>smthttpd</EM>
web server ran on UNIX and Windows 95, showing that portable
multitasking was a realistic objective.

<P>SMT 2.0 is a fresh approach that combines the experience of
these projects:
<UL>
<LI>It is built on an event-based kernel that integrates smoothly
into the event-driven state machine inside each program.
<LI>It uses Libero to abstract the multithreading logic, so that
the application program is easy to write and maintain.
<LI>It can be oriented towards socket i/o (important for Internet
server programs), towards Windows event handling, or towards any
other event source.
</UL>

<H3>Differences with Classic Multithreading</H3>

<P>The main differences between SMT and 'classic' multithreading
are:
<UL>
<LI>Multithreading works at the user level, not the kernel level.
This is sometimes called 'internal multithreading' or 'pseudo-
multithreading'.  User-level multithreading is transparent to the
operating system, and can be 100% portable (as it is in SMT).
<LI>SMT cannot make direct use of multiple CPUs, since threads are
not visible to the operating system.
<LI>Threads communicate with events as well as with semaphores.
This is a clean abstraction that lets you design an
object-oriented application.
<LI>SMT is simpler to use.
<LI>SMT is portable to (almost) any operating system and
programming language, although the primary implementation is in
ANSI C.
</UL>

<P>We note some other points of interest:
<UL>
<LI>Thread switching occurs only between dialog action modules.  A
single dialog module will always run to completion.  Thus, threads
can share resources (data, files,...) without locking, critical
sections, or other special safeguards.
<LI>SMT provides a high-level framework for constructing real
applications.  This is useful even without the multithreading
aspects.
<LI>SMT uses asynchronous or non-blocking i/o as far as possible
- for Internet sockets and file access.  This results in efficient
applications that can handle large numbers of connections with a
low overhead per connection.
</UL>

<H3>Why Use Multithreading?</H3>

<P>We will consider two specific problems.  Firstly, construction
of an industrial-scale Internet server.  Secondly, construction of
a multi-level finite-state machine application.

<P>There are many different ways to design an Internet server.
The main problem is to handle multiple connections at once
('concurrency').  The classic way to get concurrency is to use the
operating system multitasking functions.  This is straight-forward
enough.  For instance, under UNIX, the server process uses the
fork() system call to create a 'clone' of itself. At any moment
there are multiple copies of the server process, each handling one
connection.  The operating system switches rapidly between these
processes, so giving concurrency.

<P>The problems with this design become apparent when you try to
use it for large-scale work.  Firstly, it is not portable - the
fork() system call does not work on all operating systems.
Secondly, each fork() call duplicates the server program in
memory.  This duplication takes a certain time, as does the
eventual removal of the server process.  A protocol like HTTP
creates a large number of short-term connections.  Lastly, each
additional instance of the server process consumes system
resources so that a typical system cannot handle more than a few
hundred connections.

<P>There are variations on this design that eliminate some of the
problems.  For instance, you can create a fixed number of
instances of the server beforehand, then allow that number of
connections.  This eliminates the cost of creating and removing
server processes, but does not raise the ceiling on the maximum
number of connections.

<P>A more sophisticated approach is to handle multiple connections
within a single process.  This is relatively simple to arrange,
using the BSD socket select() function.  This lets a program wait
for activity on a set of open sockets.  The logic of such a
program is: wait for activity on a socket; handle the activity;
repeat.  This approach works when the logic of 'handle the
activity' is simple.  In realistic applications, however, this
logic becomes complex, and involves activity such as reading or
writing to files, or manipulating several sockets at once.

<P>The SMT kernel uses the last approach, but provides a level of
abstraction that makes the approach practical for large-scale
problems.  You can create one or several 'threads'.  Each thread
executes a copy of the finite state machine.  The basic unit of
logic in a thread is the code module.

<P>The number of threads is limited only by the memory available
to the process.  Creating or removing a thread is fast (so a new
connection can be established faster than using a fork() call),
and as far as the operating system is concerned, there is just one
process (so the cost to the operating system is lower).

<P>Let's consider the design of an application that consists of
several interworking state machines.  This is the kind of design
one finds in telecommunications and other specialised domains.
The approach can be used in many areas.  Typically, such a state
machines processes an event queue; one state machine can send
events to another.

<P>In this type of design we need to save the 'state' of each
state machine in some way so that it can process events in a
meaningful manner.  The 'state' consists of the actual state, the
last event, and context information that the state machine program
needs to remember between events.  We can define this 'state' as a
thread: the requirements are very close to that of the Internet
server described above.  If we only want a single thread in any
state machine, we can consider this a special case of the general
case, which is a full multithreaded approach.

<P>Our conclusion from these two chains of argument is that a
state-machine approach to multithreading is useful and valuable in
real applications.  Since Libero already provides a state-machine
abstraction that converts a state-machine diagram into generated
code, it is reasonable to use this mechanism to implement a
generic and portable type of multithreading.

<P>The SMT 2.x kernel works with a specific Libero code generation
schema, smtschm.c, to provide this generic multithreading.

<H3>What You Should Know</H3>

<P>If you intend to write Internet servers, you should have a
basic understanding of the concepts behind IP, TCP/IP, and UDP/IP.
While the SMT kernel does a good job of packaging and abstracting
the Internet programming model, it is no substitute for a solid
understanding of the issues involved.  We recommend that you be
familiar with these aspects at least:
<UL>
<LI>The differences between TCP/IP and UDP/IP.
<LI>How TCP and UDP socket connections work.
<LI>The BSD socket programming interface.
</UL>
The SFL socket functions provide the main abstraction layer; for
instance you will not need to consider system-specific issues such
as the WINSOCK interface.

<P>Before designing or writing an SMT application you should
understand the Libero method of program design.  The main
components of an SMT application - the agents - are designed and
written using Libero.

<P>Before writing SMT applications you should be familiar with the
standard function library (SFL), since many SFL functions are used
in a typical SMT application.

<H3>Structure Of An SMT Application</H3>

<P>An SMT application generally consists of a number of
<EM>agents</EM>, connected to the SMT kernel:

<P>We may also use an event driver to make an 'embedded
application'.  This is necessary when external events cannot be
collected by a normal SMT agent program such as the socket i/o
agent.  An example of such an application is one designed for MS
Windows.

<P>There are many other types of SMT application.  The SMT kernel
defines a number of objects, and operations on those objects.
These objects are arranged in a hierarchy: this is structural, not
morphological (they do not inherit attributes from each
other):

<PRE>
         Agent
           : \
           :  Method
         Queue
        /      \
    Thread     Event

Figure: Main SMT Objects
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>An SMT application consists of one or more <EM>agents</EM>.
An agent is written as a single program, based on one Libero
dialog definition (i.e. a finite state machine, or FSM).
<LI>An agent declares one or more <EM>methods</EM> that it can
process.  These are formal declarations of the <EM>events</EM>
that the agent is prepared to accept.  An agent that declares a
method "OPEN" will accept events called "OPEN".
<LI>An agent contains zero or more event <EM>queues</EM>.  When
you send an event somewhere, you send it to an event queue.
<LI>An event queue is handled by one or more <EM>threads</EM>.  A
thread is an instance of the finite-state machine program.
<LI>An event queue contains zero or more events.  These are events
waiting to be processed by the queue's thread(s).
<LI>Agents, methods, threads, and events are named.  Queues are
unnamed, and are referred-to by a <EM>queue id</EM> block, a token
that the SMT kernel generates when it creates a new queue.
</UL>

<P>The SMT holds these objects in a set of linked lists.  Each
thread, for instance, contains the reference of its parent queue;
a queue refers to its parent agent.

Figure: Agent Program With 3 Threads
</PRE>

<H3>Floating Event Queues</H3>

<P>In normal cases, events are sent to a queue that is held by an
agent program.  Sometimes this is a limitation: we can see cases
where non-agent programs also need to receive events.  Any program
can send an event: this is just a call to the SMT kernel API.

<P>We therefore define the concept of a <EM>floating event
queue</EM>; that is, an event queue that is managed by some
program that is not constructed as an agent:

<PRE>
        Program
           :
         Queue
           :
         Event

Figure: Floating Event Queue
</PRE>

<P>The designer of the application must also find a way to service
the event queue, since the SMT kernel cannot schedule and execute
such a program.

<H3>Routers</H3>

<P>In most cases, one queue is served by one thread.  Thus, when
you send an event to a queue, you are effectively sending it to a
specific thread.

In some cases, it is better to share one queue among several
threads.  Imagine an agent that executes database requests coming
from a set of clients.  A thread takes an event, processes it, and
returns a reply.  Each event is independent, and may take some
time to process.  It makes sense to start several threads, so that
several events can be processed in parallel.  It would be wrong to
allocate one queue per thread, however, for two reasons.  Firstly,
this implies that there are N queues which the clients must know
about.  Secondly, it implies that someone (client or agent)
chooses a queue for each event.  Consequently, events may be
waiting in the queue for one thread while another thread is idle.
By allocating just one queue, shared between all the agent
threads, events are processed at full speed, in arrival order.

<P>An agent is either defined as a <EM>router</EM>, or not.  When
an agent is a router, it is legal to create multiple threads with
the same name.  All threads in a router agent share a single event
queue.

<H3>Internal and External Events</H3>

<P>SMT agents are built as event-driven Libero programs.  We
define two kinds of event: an <EM>internal event</EM> (supplied by
the program itself) and an <EM>external event</EM> (taken from the
event queue).  If we consider a normal Libero program, all events
are internal.  The SMT kernel adds the concept of external
events.

<P>When you design the program dialog, you do not distinguish
internal and external events.  Indeed, a name like "Ok" can be
used for both types of event.

<P>The SMT kernel <EM>delivers</EM> an external event when the
program did not supply an internal event itself.  This occurs at a
state transition, i.e. after executing the action modules for an
event.  When an external event is delivered, it is converted into
an appropriate internal event.

<P>To put it another way: if none of the action modules put a
value into the_next_event, then the SMT kernel will pull an event
from the event queue, translate it into a suitable value, and put
that into the_next_event instead.

<P>The <EM>methods</EM> define the translation from external event
to internal event.  External events that do not match declared
methods are rejected.  This is usually a programming error, so an
error message is sent to the console.

<H3>Event Management</H3>

<P>The SMT kernel provides an level of event management.  Firstly,
it will destroy undelivered events after a specified expiry
period.  Secondly, it will automatically send return events to
acknowledge receipt or non-receipt of an event.  This works as
follows: when you send an event, you may specify reply events for
delivery, rejection, and expiry.

<H3>Priorities and Scheduling</H3>

<P>The SMT kernel has a simple priority and scheduling mechanism.
Agents run with a certain priority level (a number from 1 to 255).
When the SMT kernel delivers events to threads, it schedules the
threads for execution, by placing them in a queue (the <EM>active
list</EM>).  Threads with higher priorities are placed at the
start of the active list.  No account is taken of the time spent
in the active list, so it is quite possible for a set of
high-priority threads to take-up all execution time.  This
normally does not happen, since such threads will eventually wait
for events from somewhere else, so become passive.

<P>Events have a similar priority level, defined by the accepting
program, in the event method.  When the SMT kernel delivers an
event, it chooses the event with the highest priority.  One
example of a high-priority event is <EM>shutdown</EM>, which is
sent to all threads when the SMT kernel receives a 'kill' signal
(i.e. when someone decides to stop the running program).

<P>You can change agent and event priorities on the fly, although
this may get a little complex to manage.  You can also process the
events in an event queue directly, without waiting for the SMT
kernel to deliver each one.

<P>In general we recommend that you leave agents and events with
unspecified priority - i.e. the normal priority level - unless
there are good reasons for doing otherwise.

<H3>Native Programs Vs. Foreign Programs</H3>

<P>A <EM>native program</EM> is designed as a finite-state machine
(FSM) and built using Libero and the smtschm.c schema.  A native
program can be multithreaded.  It is tightly integrated with the
SMT kernel: the kernel supplies events to the program, schedules
and executes threads, etc.

<P>A <EM>native program</EM> is also called a <EM>agent</EM>. The
two terms are equivalent.

<P>A <EM>foreign program</EM> is not based on the smtschm.c
schema.  It is always single threaded, and while it may call SMT
kernel functions, it is not integrated with the kernel.  Typically
a foreign program calls the SMT kernel to send and receive events
and manage floating event queues.

<H3>The SMT Kernel Meta-State-Machine</H3>

<P>We can consider the application (an ensemble of agents, queues,
threads, and events) as a meta-state-machine (i.e. a state machine
that defines a set of state machines).  The application has three
states:
<UL>
<LI><EM>Latent</EM>: we are initialising, but not yet ready to
start executing the threads.
<LI><EM>Active</EM>: we are executing threads.
<LI><EM>Halted</EM>: there are no more active threads, and no
events left to deliver.
</UL>

<P>We do not usually define this as a Libero dialog, though it is
possible to do so.  What we must do is to write a foreign program,
a <EM>stub</EM>, that implements the application meta-state-
machine.  This is the stub for an Internet ECHO daemon, showing
the three states:

<PRE>
#include "sfl.h"                   /*  SFL library header file  */
#include "smtlib.h"                /*  SMT kernel functions     */

int main (int argc, char *argv [])
{
    /*  Application is latent - initialise it                   */
    $(*smt_init) ();                   /*  Initialise SMT kernel    */
    $(*smtecho_init) (NULL);           /*  Initialise ECHO agent    */

    /*  Application is active - execute it                      */
    $(*smt_exec_full) ();              /*  Run until completed      */

    /*  Application is halted - terminate it                    */
    $(*smt_term) ();                   /*  Shut-down SMT kernel     */
    return (0);
}
</PRE>

<P>This main code is the glue that joins the various pieces of the
application.

.page Using The SMT Kernel API
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>The SMT kernel API is aimed mainly at native programs.
However, you can also use the event-passing facilities in foreign

</DL>

<P>The SMT kernel API works with a number of objects - agents,
threads, queues - which are defined as C structures.  The fields
in these structures are the properties of the object.  The SMT
objects contain <EM>private</EM> fields, which you should never
change or refer to, and <EM>public</EM> fields, which you are free
to change and use.  We do not discuss the private fields, except
to note that these contain information that is internal to the SMT
kernel, or reflect particular implementations that may change.

<P>These are the SMT objects and their public fields:

<PRE>
AGENT                      /*  Agent descriptor                 */
    AGENT  *next, *prev    /*    Doubly-linked list             */
    NODE    methods        /*    Methods accepted by agent      */
    NODE    queues         /*    Queues defined for agent       */
    char   *name           /*    Agent's name                   */
    Bool    router         /*    Default = FALSE                */
    int     priority       /*    Default = SMT_PRIORITY_NORMAL  */
    long    max_threads    /*    Default = 0 (no limit)         */
    long    cur_threads    /*    Current number of threads      */
    long    top_threads    /*    Max. number threads we had     */
    long    thread_tally   /*    How many threads created       */
    long    switch_tally   /*    How many context switches      */
</PRE>

<P>An agent defines one program written using the Libero SMT
schema.  When the generated code initialises, it automatically
creates an agent object.  You may change the router, priority, and
max_threads fields, but not the other fields.

<PRE>
METHOD                     /*  Method descriptor                */
    METHOD *next, *prev    /*    Doubly-linked list             */
    AGENT  *agent          /*    Parent agent descriptor        */
    char   *name           /*    Name of method                 */
    int     priority       /*    Default = SMT_PRIORITY_NORMAL  */
    int     event_number   /*    Internal event number          */
</PRE>

<P>The start-up code for an agent (in Initialise-The-Program)
creates a method for each external event it wants to handle.  You
may change the priority and event_number fields, but not the other
fields.

<PRE>
THREAD                     /*  Thread descriptor                */
    THREAD  *next, *prev   /*    Doubly-linked list             */
    QUEUE   *queue         /*    Parent queue descriptor        */
    long     thread_id     /*    Thread identifier number       */
    char    *name          /*    Name of thread                 */
    Bool     animate       /*    Animate this thread            */
    void    *tcb           /*    Thread context block (TCB)     */
    EVENT   *event         /*    Last-received event            */
</PRE>

<P>Any part of the application can create a thread in an agent, if
it knows the name of the agent.  You may change the animate field,
but not the other fields.

<PRE>
QUEUE                      /*  Event queue descriptor           */
    QUEUE  *next, *prev    /*    Doubly-linked list             */
    AGENT  *agent          /*    Parent agent descriptor        */
    NODE    events         /*    Events in queue                */
    NODE    threads        /*    Threads for queue              */
    QID     qid            /*    Queue ID descriptor            */
    int     max_events     /*    Maximum allowed events         */
    int     cur_events     /*    Current number of events       */
</PRE>

<P>The SMT kernel automatically creates event queues as needed.
Generally it will create one event queue per thread.  When an
agent is defined as a router, however, it only creates an event
queue for the first thread.  You can also create floating event
queues.  You may change the max_events fields, but not the other
fields.  Note that each queue has a unique QID; this is the
identifier for the queue, and the information you need to send an
event to a queue.

<PRE>
EVENT                      /*  Event in queue                   */
    EVENT  *next, *prev    /*    Doubly-linked list             */
    QUEUE  *queue          /*    Parent queue descriptor        */
    QID     sender         /*    Replies come back here         */
    char   *name           /*    Name of event                  */
    size_t  body_size      /*    Size of event body in bytes    */
    char   *body           /*    Event body                     */
    char   *accept_event   /*    Reply if we accept event       */
    char   *reject_event   /*    Reply if we reject event       */
    char   *expire_event   /*    Reply if we expire event       */
    time_t  timeout        /*    Expires at this time (or 0)    */
</PRE>

<P>Any part of the application can send an event to an event queue
using the event_send() function.  The queue may be served by a
thread, or not (if it is a floating event queue).  You should not
change any of the fields in the event object: the sender, body,
and body_size fields are generally interesting.

<PRE>
SEMAPH                     /*  Semaphore definition             */
    SEMAPH  *next, *prev;  /*    Doubly-linked list             */
    char    *name;         /*    Name of semaphore              */
</PRE>

<P>Semaphores are for synchronising agents, for instance for
exclusive access to some resource.  We implement general
semaphores, i.e. they can take any value of 0 or greater (the
value is defined as an integer).

<H3>Initialisation and Termination</H3>

<P>An SMT application must explicitly initialise and shut-down the
SMT kernel.  This lets the kernel create global objects (such as
the symbol table) and then destroy them when finished.

<P>The $(*smt_init)() function initialises the SMT kernel.  The
$(*smt_term)() function shuts-down the SMT kernel.  These are
generally the first and last SMT functions that the application
calls.  Usually, we'll put these calls in the stub (main)
program.

<P>Any part of the application can call $(*smt_atexit)() to
register a shut-down function; these shut-down functions are
called by $(*smt_term)(), in the order that you declare them.

<H3>Creating A Thread</H3>

<P>Any program can create a thread in any agent in the application
using the thread_create() function.  To create a thread you must
know the name of the agent and the name of the thread you want to
create.

<P>A thread's name is local within the agent, and lets an outside
program look-up the event queue for that thread.  There are
various ways to name threads.  In single-threaded agents, it is
useful to leave the thread name empty (specified as an empty
string - "").  In multithreaded agents, the thread name can
correspond to some resource name.  For instance, in the echo
agent, the thread uses the connection socket number as its name.
In a <EM>router</EM> agent, several threads can have the same
name; since the threads in such an agent share the same event
queue, this allows a program to unambigouously find the event
queue from the thread name.

<P>This is how a single-threaded agent (e.g. the operator console)
creates a thread:

<PRE>
    /*  Create initial, unnamed thread                          */
    $(*thread_create) (AGENT_NAME, "");
</PRE>

<P>This is how the $(*SMTECHO=echo agent) creates a thread to
handle a new connection (tcb-&gt; handle contains the handle of
the echo master socket):

<PRE>
    SOCKET
        slave_socket;           /*  Connected socket            */
    static char
        thread_name [12];       /*  Socket number as string     */

    slave_socket = accept_socket (tcb-&gt; handle);
    if (slave_socket != INVALID_SOCKET)
      {
        sprintf (thread_name, "%d", slave_socket);
        $(*thread_create) (AGENT_NAME, thread_name);
      }
</PRE>

<H3>Sending and Receiving Events</H3>

<P>These are the API functions that you can use to send an event:
<DL>
<DT>$(*event_send)()</DT>
<DD>Send an event to some event queue.</DD>
<DT>$(*senderr)()</DT>
<DD>Send the current strerror (errno) to some queue.</DD>
<DT>$(*sendfmt)()</DT>
<DD>Format a text using printf conventions and send to some
queue.</DD>
</DL>

<P>In all cases, the target queue is specified as a <EM>QID</EM>.
The QID is a location-independent queue identifier that the SMT
kernel creates for each queue.  We use a QID instead of the
address of the queue object so that events can be sent between
processes running in different address spaces.  (Although this is
not yet implemented.)

<P>When you send an event, you specify an event name.  An agent
program must have declared a method for each event it can accept.
There is no such restriction for other programs that manage event
queues themselves.

<P>An event has a body, which is a block of text or binary data
that is copied to the receiving event queue.  You should always
ensure that event bodies are portable, since the receiving event
queue could in principle be on a different system.  Furthermore,
an event body cannot include the address of an object or variable:
events can cross address spaces (i.e. be sent to other processes)
so that such addresses are not meaningful.

<H3>Sending An Initial Event To A Thread</H3>

<P>You can send an event to a thread as soon as it has been
created.  This can be useful if you need to pass arguments to a
child thread.  The event will be delivered <EM>after</EM> the
initialise_the_thread module, if you do not specify a value for
<TT>the_next_event</TT>.  For an example, see the echo agent
$(*SMTECHO).

<H3>Event Lifespan and Acknowledgment</H3>

<P>The $(*event_send)() call lets a program specify these optional
arguments:
<UL>
<LI>Reply queue - usually the queue for the thread or program that
sent the event.
<LI>Accept event - an event that is returned when the event has
been sucessfully delivered (though not necessarily processed).  If
left unspecified, the caller will not be informed when the event
is delivered.
<LI>Reject event - an event that is returned if the event is
rejected by the recipient.  (Typically it is not accepted by the
thread in its current state.)  If left unspecified, the caller
will not be informed when the event is rejected.
<LI>Timeout - a timeout in seconds after which the event will
expire.
<LI>Expire event - an event that is returned when the event has
expired dues to a timeout.  If left unspecified, the caller will
not be informed when the event expires.
</UL>

<P>When a program wants to inspect the events in a queue, it uses
$(*event_iterate)(), which walks through the queue, event by
event. To take an event off the queue, a program calls
$(*event_accept)(). This automatically sends an accept event, if
specified.
If queue is empty it simply returns with an 'not found' feedback.
Some programs implement event priorities by combining
$(*event_iterate)() with $(*event_accept)().  A program may
manipulate several event queues.

<P>To remove an event without using it, a program calls
$(*event_destroy)().  The $(*event_destroy)() call automatically
sends a reject event, if specified.

<P>The SMT kernel handles event expiry automatically for native
programs.  Programs that handle floating event queues must expire
old events explicitly by calling $(*queue_flush)() before they
start to process waiting events.

<H3>Using Priorities</H3>

<P>The SMT kernel provides support for event priorities and for
thread priorities.  These work as follows:
<UL>
<LI>When several events are waiting to be delivered to an agent,
the event with the highest priority is always delivered first.
When several events have the same priority, the oldest event is
delivered first.
<LI>When a thread is scheduled for execution it is always
scheduled before the first thread with a lower priority.
</UL>

<P>In practice we use priorities rarely, and for specific cases
only.  In the current version of the SMT kernel we use a high
priority for shutdown events, and a low priority for the socket
agent.  All other events and threads have normal (equal)
priority.


.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Writing A Native SMT Program
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>A native program is a <EM>agent</EM>.  To build an agent you:
<UL>
<LI>Design a dialog using Libero, and base the dialog on the
smtschm.c schema (specify -schema=smtschm.c).
<LI>Generate a skeleton program.
<LI>Modify the program and dialog, regenerate, compile, and link
the application, and repeat until satisfied.
</UL>

<P>When you design an agent you must decide whether the it is
single-threaded or multithreaded.  What's the difference?
<UL>
<LI>A single-threaded agent handles just one logical thread; a
multithreaded agent handles multiple logical threads in
parallel.
<LI>A single-threaded agent manages one event queue; a
multithreaded agent manages (usually) several event queues.
<LI>A multithreaded agent is usually 'connection oriented' while
a single-threaded agent is usually 'service oriented'.
</UL>

<P>By convention, a single-threaded agent creates an unnamed
thread when it initialises.  A multithreaded agent, by contrast,
typically create a new thread for each new connection, and uses a
different name for each thread.

<P>An example of a single-threaded agent is the operator console.
This is a program that accepts error messages or warnings from
other parts of the application, then does something useful with
them.  (The current implementation writes them to stderr.)  The
operator console has no need for multiple threads.

<P>An example of a multithreaded agent is the logging agent.  This
is a program that manages log files on behalf of other application
programs.  It does this at a low priority, and without blocking,
so that log file data is written without disturbing ongoing work.
The logging agent can write to several log files in parallel: it
does this by having one thread for each log file.

<P>To specify that an agent is single-threaded, define
SINGLE_THREADED as TRUE near the start of the program.  For
instance, this code comes from the SMTOPER agent:

<PRE>
/*- Definitions ------------------------------------------------*/

#define AGENT_NAME      SMT_OPERATOR  /*  Our public name       */
#define SINGLE_THREADED TRUE          /*  Single-threaded agent */
</PRE>

<H3>Initialising An agent</H3>

<P>An agent program must be 'initialised' before it can do any
useful work.  For instance, to initialise the logging agent, the
application must call the function $(*smtlog_init)().  Generally,
agents are initialised by the stub program, or by other agents.
We generally recommend that an agent always try to initialise
every agent it requires.  It is safe to call initialisation
function for an agent several times; only the first call has any
effect.

<P>The initialisation function is the only public function for a
agent.  Once an agent is initialised, it communicates with other
programs only via events.

<P>An agent program is based on a Libero dialog, and is 'driven'
by a chunk of code generated by Libero.  This code (defined as an
#include file) handles the initialisation of the agent.  The code
looks something like this (we explain each part):

<PRE>
if ($(*agent_lookup) (AGENT_NAME))
    return (0);                 /*  Agent already declared     */
</PRE>

<P>The $(*agent_lookup)() function returns NULL if an agent object
with the specified name already exists.  Otherwise it returns a
pointer to the agent object.  Here we check that the agent has
not already been declared.  The generated code assumes that
AGENT_NAME has been defined to hold the name of the agent.
AGENT_NAME can be a variable or a pre-processor macro (the
generated skeleton program defines it as a macro).

<PRE>
if ((agent = $(*agent_declare) (AGENT_NAME)) == NULL)
    return (-1);                /*  Could not declare agent    */
</PRE>

<P>The $(*agent_declare)() function returns a pointer to the
newly-created agent object.  If there was an error (e.g. not
enough memory), it returns NULL.

<PRE>
#if (defined (SINGLE_THREADED))
agent-&gt; tcb_size    = 0;    /*  No context block            */
agent-&gt; max_threads = 1;    /*    and max. 1 thread         */
#else
agent-&gt; tcb_size    = sizeof (TCB);
#endif
</PRE>

<P>Once the agent has been created, the generated code sets the
thread context block (TCB) size depending on whether the agent is
single threaded or multithreaded.  A single-threaded agent does
not need TCBs, so the size is zero.  The code assumes that
SINGLE_THREADED has been defined as a macro if required.  The
generated code then sets a variety of fields in the agent block.
This allows the SMT kernel to 'drive' the agent program
correctly.

<P>This is how a typical multithreaded agent program initialises
(this code is taken from smtlog.c):

<PRE>
#define AGENT_NAME  SMT_LOGGING    /*  Our public name         */
</PRE>

<P>The SMT_LOGGING symbol is defined in the standard SMT header
file, smtlib.h, since this agent is part of the standard package.
For your own agents you would define AGENT_NAME as a string
literal.  Note that agent names must be unique within the
application.

<PRE>
int smtlog_init (void)
{
    AGENT   *agent;             /*  Handle for our agent        */
    THREAD  *thread;            /*  Handle to console thread    */
#   include "smtlog.i"          /*  Include dialog interpreter  */
</PRE>

<P>The initialisation code in smtlog.i assumes that a variable
'agent' is defined.  Then, you can refer to the agent in
following code using this 'handle'.  The first thing we do is to
declare each method:

<PRE>
/*                           Method     Event value  Priority  */
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SHUTDOWN", shutdown_event,
                                             SMT_PRIORITY_MAX);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "OPEN",     open_event,         0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "PUT",      put_event,          0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "CLOSE",    close_event,        0);
</PRE>

<P>Methods names are not case-sensitive, but by convention we
specify them in uppercase.  Every agent must support the SHUTDOWN
method; this is sent to each agent when the SMT kernel terminates
(for instance when interrupted).  SHUTDOWN gets a high priority,
so that an agent will handle shutdown events before any other
waiting events.  The other events get a normal priority (0 means
'default').

<P>You can define several methods for the same event.  The SMT
kernel uses the set of methods to translate an incoming external
event into an internal dialog event.

<PRE>
    /*  Ensure that operator console is running, else start it  */
    $(*smtoper_init) ();
    if ((thread = $(*thread_lookup) (SMT_OPERATOR, "")) != NULL)
        console = thread-&gt; queue-&gt; qid;
    else
        return (-1);
</PRE>

<P>This agent sends error messages to the operator console agent,
which is generally a good idea.  It initialises the agent (with
no effect if the agent is already initialised) and then gets the
console queue id, so it can send events to the operator console.
Note how we do a $(*thread_lookup)() with an empty thread name.
The operator console is single threaded, and that single thread
has no name.

<PRE>
    /*  Signal okay to caller that we initialised okay          */
    return (0);
}
</PRE>

<P>Finally, if everything went as expected, we return 0 to signal
that to the calling program.  This is a convention, although you
can write the initialisation function any way you like, accepting
any arguments and returning any value that is appropriate.

<H3>The Thread Context Block</H3>

<P>Threads can share data: any global data in the agent program
is de-facto shared by all threads.  Since threads also need
'private' data, each thread owns a block of memory called the
Thread Context Block, or TCB.  The SMT kernel allocates such a
block when a thread is created.

<P>The TCB is a structure that contains arbitrary fields.  You
define this structure at the start of your program.  All code
modules in the program receive a pointer to this structure: they
use the pointer to reference private data.  For instance, this is
how the smtlog.c agent declares its TCB:

<PRE>
typedef struct                  /*  Thread context block:       */
{
    int handle;                 /*    Handle for i/o            */
} TCB;
</PRE>

This is how the smtlog.c agent opens a file:

<PRE>
/*******************   OPEN THREAD LOGFILE   ********************/

MODULE open_thread_logfile (THREAD *thread)
{
    char
        *logfile_name;

    tcb = thread-&gt; tcb;         /*  Point to thread's context   */

    /*  Event body or thread name supplies name for log file    */
    logfile_name = (strused (thread-&gt; event-&gt; body)?
                    thread-&gt; event-&gt; body:
                    thread-&gt; name);
    tcb-&gt; handle = $(*lazy_creat) (logfile_name, S_IREAD | S_IWRITE);
    if (io_completed)
      {
        if (tcb-&gt; handle &lt; 0)   /*  If open failed, send error  */
          {                     /*    to console, and terminate */
            $(*sendfmt) (&console, "ERROR",
                     "Could not open %s for output",
                      logfile_name);
            $(*senderr) (&console);
            $(*raise_exception) (exception_event);
          }
      }
}
</PRE>

<H3>Choosing Event Names</H3>

<P>We generally use the same name for the method as for the event.
E.g. CLOSE and close_event.  This is not obligatory, and in some
cases not appropriate, but it does make the program easier to
understand when dialog event names correspond to methods.

<H3>Mechanics Of Event Delivery</H3>

<P>The agent kernel delivers events to threads when required.
This happens at a precise moment: when the thread moves to a new
dialog state -- after executing the action module list -- and no
internal event was provided.

<P>When a thread moves into a state, the set of possible events is
those events defined in that state, plus the events defined in the
Defaults state, if any.

<P>The SMT kernel takes the following event (or the event with the
highest priority) and tries to match it to a method name.  If the
event does not match a method, the event is rejected.  Otherwise
it is accepted and translated into an internal event number.  If
the internal event is illegal at that moment in the dialog, this
causes a fatal dialog error (the thread rejects the event).

<H3>Waiting For An External Event</H3>

<P>Normally the SMT kernel delivers an external event when the
dialog moves to a new state, and no event was specified.  In some
cases this can make a dialog rather large, since you need to break
each step up into states.  The $(*event_wait)() function causes
the dialog to halt until an event can be taken from the queue.
When several threads are executable, this function also switches
execution to the next thread.

<P>The $(*event_wait)() call sets the variable
"the_external_event".  This should be the last statement in a
dialog module.  When used in the last module in a list, it has
strictly no effect.

<H3>Sending Structured Event Data</H3>

<P>Events can optionally have a body to carry additional
information.  When you send textual data - for instance a string -
the event body can be transferred between programs without any
type of conversion.  (We ignore problems of character-set
conversion at present.)

<P>When you need to send several items in one event body, we speak
of sending <EM>structured data</EM>.  Structured data consists of
a mixture of data items of these types:
<UL>
<LI>Single bytes
<LI>Characters
<LI>Double-bytes
<LI>Quad-bytes
<LI>Booleans
<LI>Null-terminated strings
<LI>Blocks of binary data
</UL>

<P>An example of events with structured data are those accepted by
the socket i/o agent $(*SMTSOCK).

<P>In C, we can group the data items in a structure, hence the
term.  We cannot, however, simply copy the structure into the
message and send that.  We cannot copy the address of the
structure.  Both these methods will work today, but an event may
(in the future) be sent to an agent in a different process,
perhaps running on a different machine.
<UL>
<LI>The agent may run in a different address space, so passing
addresses is definitely not a good idea.
<LI>Structures can contain empty space (padding) that depends on
the compiler used, the compiler options, and the machine word
size.  So, if you pass a structure as-is, the data may not map
correctly to the receiving program's structure.
<LI>Different systems use different ways of ordering the bytes in
a multi-byte integer.  One often hears the terms 'little-endian'
and 'big-endian'; these are just the two main varieties.
</UL>

<P>Our solution is to take each data field in turn, and pack the
structure into a machine-independent stream.  We transmit this
stream, then do the reverse unpacking in the target program.

<P>To do the conversion we use the SFL functions exdr_read() and
exdr_write().

<P>This is more work than just sending the complete structure, but
is the only way to ensure that data can safely be sent between two
programs that may be running on separate systems.

<H3>Sending Events Within An Agent</H3>

<P>Within one agent, you do not need to use the EXDR functions.
It is quite acceptable to pass data in a structure.  To do this,
<UL>
<LI>Define a structure for each event you want to send;
<LI>To send an event, fill-in the structure fields and send the
structure using the event_send function;
<LI>Access the individual fields using a type cast as follows:
<PRE>(SOMESTRUCT *) thread-> event-> body-> some_field</PRE>
</UL>

<H3>Ignoring External Events</H3>

<P>In some cases, you may want to ignore reply events sent by an
agent.  This can be useful to simplify a dialog.  This is how we
declare a method to ignore some specific event:

<PRE>
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOME_EVENT", SMT_NULL_EVENT, 0);
</PRE>

<H3>Non-Blocking File Access</H3>

<P>The SMT kernel provides a minimum file access layer that is
safe to use in multithreaded programs.  To understand what this
means, first understand what is 'unsafe'.

<P>On some systems, like UNIX and Digital VMS, file access may
need resources that are not always available - like memory for
buffers.  If you ask to read some data from a file, and there is a
problem, the operating system may loop a few times - waiting and
then trying again - before finally returning to the calling
program.  In the meantime your program and all threads are
blocked.

<P>The general solution is to request <EM>non-blocking file
access</EM>.  Then, in the case of a resource problem, the
operating will not loop, but will return at once with an error
code that means 'try again'.  The SMT kernel integrates this
solution with its thread management, so that a thread waiting for
file access will loop slowly, allowing other threads to continue
to run.

<P>To make this work, you should not call the open(), creat(),
read(), or write() functions directly in your program.  Instead,
call the SMT kernel functions $(*lazy_open)(), $(*lazy_creat)(),
$(*lazy_read)(), $(*lazy_write)(), and $(*lazy_close)().
Furthermore, construct your code like this:

<PRE>
rc = $(*lazy_write) (tcb-> handle, formatted, fmtsize);
if (io_completed && rc < 0)     /*  If write failed send error  */
  {                             /*    to console and terminate  */
    $(*sendfmt) (&console, "ERROR",
             "Could not write to %s", thread-> name);
    $(*senderr) (&console);
    $(*raise_exception) (exception_event);
  }
</PRE>

<P>If <TT>io_completed</TT> is FALSE, then the code module should
do no further work.  In this case the SMT kernel automatically re-
executes the <EM>entire</EM> code module.

<P>This is simple and sufficient for sequential file access.  If
you need heavy database access, where one SELECT statement may
take a long time to complete, you'll find that your program
responds slowly.  A better architecture in such cases is to handle
database requests in a separate process, which talks to your
application program using sockets.  The requests will take the
same time to complete, but in the meantime other threads - e.g.
handling new connections - can run normally.

<P>While we generally recommend you use the non-blocking i/o
functions, there are instances where this is not really necessary.
Most obviously, when an application is initialising (e.g. reading
configuration files) or terminating (dumping data to a log file),
there is no need to avoid blocking i/o.  In such cases, you can
access sequential files directly.

<H3>Real-time Programming</H3>

<P>When you call a function like $(*lazy_read)() and it detects a
'busy' condition, it sets <TT>io_completed</TT> to FALSE, and
automatically re-executes the current code module.  You may want
to manage this yourself, however.  It can also be useful to have a
similar looping when you access a socket and receive the EAGAIN
error code.

<P>The $(*recycle_module)() function lets you control this looping
explicitly.  For example, we can decide to abort a file access
after more than RETRY_MAX retries:

<PRE>
typedef struct                  /*  Thread context block:       */
{
    int handle;                 /*    Handle for i/o            */
    int retries;                /*    Number of retries so far  */
} TCB;
</PRE>

Let's assume that 'retries' has been set to zero, either during
thread initialisation (okay), or by a specific dialog module
(better).  We can then try to open a file like this, calling
$(*recycle_module)() with a FALSE argument to prevent looping when
we have retried too often:

<PRE>
/********************   OPEN THREAD LOGFILE   *******************/

MODULE open_thread_logfile (THREAD *thread)
{
    tcb = thread-&gt; tcb;         /*  Point to thread's context   */

    /*  Our thread's name is the name for the log file          */
    tcb-&gt; handle = $(*lazy_creat)
                      (thread-&gt; name, S_IREAD | S_IWRITE);
    if (io_completed)
      {
        /*  If open failed, send error to console, and end      */
        if (tcb-&gt; handle &lt; 0)
          {
            $(*sendfmt) (&console, "ERROR",
                     "Could not open %s for output", thread-&gt; name);
            $(*senderr) (&console);
            $(*raise_exception) (exception_event);
          }
      }
    else
      {
        if (++tcb-> retries == RETRY_MAX)
          {
            $(*sendfmt) (&console, "ERROR",
                     "Could not open %s for output", thread-&gt; name);
            $(*sendfmt) (&console, "ERROR", "Too many retries.")
            $(*raise_exception) (exception_event);
            $(*recycle_module) (FALSE);
          }
      }
}
</PRE>

<H3>Using Semaphores</H3>

<P>A <EM>semaphore</EM> is an object that you can use to
synchronise threads, lock resources, etc.  Semaphores are widely-
used in multithreaded and parallel computing, and the SMT kernel
implements semaphores in a conventional manner.  Semaphores have
these characteristics:
<UL>
<LI>Any program can create or destroy semaphores, at any time,
using $(*semaph_create)() and $(*semaph_destroy)().
<LI>Semaphores are identified by name and can be located using
$(*semaph_lookup)().
<LI>Any resource - such as a file - can be <EM>protected</EM> by a
semaphore through convention.  All parties that access the
resource agree to use a single semaphore to lock access to the
resource.
<LI>Semaphores have a numeric value that is 0 or greater.
<LI>The initial value for a semaphore indicates the number of
parties that can access the semaphore's resource at once.
'Normal' <EM>binary semaphores</EM> have an initial value of 1.
The SMT kernel permits <EM>general semaphores</EM> with an initial
value of 1 or greater.
<LI>A thread that wants to access a semaphore's resource uses
$(*semaph_wait)() to wait until the semaphore is ready, then it
decrements the semaphore's value.
<LI>When a thread has finished using the resource it uses
$(*semaph_signal)() to increment the semaphore's value, so allow
other threads to access the resource.
</UL>

<H3>Replacing The Standard Agents</H3>

<P>In realistic projects you will want to replace the operator
console agent and perhaps the logging agent with your own,
customised versions.  One way to do this is to modify the code of
the programs we supply.  However, this just causes maintenance
problems.  A better way is to use the existing code as a basis for
new agents that use the same agent name (but written as a
different source file).  Initialise the replacement agent from
your main() function.  Then, the standard agent will never be
initialised.  All events normally sent to the standard agent will
be sent to your agent instead.  Do not try to change the form or
meaning of events sent to the standard agents.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using The SMT API In A Foreign Program
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>In an SMT application there will always be some
<EM>foreign</EM> programs.  Some examples are:
<UL>
<LI>The stub that starts-up the application.
<LI>Programs that interface with non-SMT event-supplying
systems.
</UL>

<P>It may make sense in some applications to write all programs as
foreign.  For instance, you could use the SMT kernel simply to
send events between programs without using the multithreading
facilities.

<H3>Writing A Stub Program</H3>

<P>When you build a new SMT application you must also write a STUB
program (the main() function).  The stub program usually does
this:
<UL>
<LI>It initialises the SMT kernel by calling $(*smt_init)().
<LI>It initialises each agent that it needs.
<LI>It tells the SMT kernel to execute the application by calling
$(*smt_exec_full)().
<LI>It terminates the SMT kernel by calling $(*smt_term)().
</UL>

<P>When you compile and link the stub, you create the executable
program for the application.

<H3>Managing A Floating Event Queue</H3>

<P>An interface between a native program (or a thread) and a
foreign program consists of at least an event queue in either
direction.  The SMT kernel automatically handles the event queue
for the native program.  You must handle the other event queue
yourself:

<PRE>
       Foreign                               Native
   .--------------.                     .--------------.
   : event_send() :-----------&gt; ()()()():              |
   :              |()()()() &lt;-----:-----: event_send() |
   `=============="    :          :     `=============="
                       :        normal event queue
                       `----- floating event queue

Figure: Managing a floating event queue
</PRE>

<P>The program that sends an event does not know whether the event
queue is floating or not, although it can find this out if it has
to, by examining the queue object.  The difference between a
floating event queue and a normal event queue is that you must get
events off a floating event queue yourself.  You can use the API
function calls:
<DL>
<DT>$(*event_accept)()</DT>
<DD>Accept the next event from an event queue.</DD>
<DT>$(*event_reject)()</DT>
<DD>Reject the next event from an event queue.</DD>
<DT>$(*event_expire)()</DT>
<DD>Expire the next event from an event queue.</DD>
<DT>$(*event_discard)()</DT>
<DD>Discard the next event from an event queue.</DD>
<DT>$(*event_iterate)()</DT>
<DD>Find the next event in an event queue.</DD>
<DT>$(*event_destroy)()</DT>
<DD>Destroy a specific event.</DD>
</DL>

<P>You can use methods if you need to.  This can be a convenient
way of translating event names into internal numbers of some sort.
For instance, if you design the foreign program using the standard
Libero C schema, you can use methods to translate event names into
internal numbers, much as the SMT kernel does for a native
program.  This is (more or less) the SMT kernel code that does
this translation:

<PRE>
    EVENT   *event;             /*  Event information block     */
    EVENT   *deliver_event;     /*  Event to deliver            */
    METHOD  *method;            /*  Method information block    */
    THREAD  *active;            /*  Thread in active list       */
    int     top_priority;       /*  Highest event priority      */
    int     event_number;       /*  Number for event to deliver */

    /*  Get event to deliver - find event with highest priority */
    top_priority  = -1;
    deliver_event = NULL;
    event = queue-&gt; events.next;
    while ((NODE *) event != &queue-&gt; events)
      {
        /*  Lookup method; if method not declared, reject event */
        method = $(*method_lookup) (agent, event-&gt; name);
        if (method == NULL)
          {
            /*  Reject this event, but keep place in queue...   */
            $(*sendfmt) (&console, "ERROR",
                     "Event %s not declared by %s",
                      event-&gt; name, agent-&gt; name);
            event = event-&gt; next;
            $(*event_reject) (queue, event-&gt; prev);
            continue;           /*  Process this new event      */
          }
        if (method-&gt; priority &gt; top_priority)
          {
            deliver_event = event;
            event_number  = method-&gt; event_number;
            top_priority  = method-&gt; priority;
          }
        event = event-&gt; next;
      }
    if (deliver_event)
      {
        /*  Deliver event, move thread to active queue          */
        thread-&gt; event          = $(*event_accept) (queue,
                                  deliver_event);
        thread-&gt; the_next_event = event_number;
        thread-&gt; active         = TRUE;
      }
</PRE>

<H3>Executing The Application</H3>

<P>The main() function in an executable is a foreign program.
Since a foreign program is external to the multithreading process
of the SMT kernel, control must pass back and forwards between the
SMT kernel and the foreign program.  Typically this is a loop like
this:
<UL>
<LI>Collect any events and send them to the appropriate event
queues.
<LI>Call the SMT kernel to deliver the events and execute all
active threads.
<LI>Repeat until the application has ended.
</UL>

<P>To do the second step, the foreign program calls
$(*smt_exec_full)().  This function runs all the agent threads
until there are no more events left to deliver, or active
threads.

<P>Sometimes it is better to call $(*smt_exec_step)()
repeatedly. This function delivers events, but only executes the
first active thread.  This function provides a finer-grain
control.  For instance, if the application loops because two
threads send each other events in a never-ending loop (usually a
programming error), the $(*smt_exec_full)() call will never
return, while the $(*smt_exec_step)() call will return each
time that the kernel switches between the threads.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Standard SMT Agents
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>The SMT architecture lets one build an application out of
existing and new agents.  We provide a number of standard agents.
All these agents correctly support the <TT>shutdown</TT> method,
which the SMT kernel broadcasts when it needs to end the
application.

<P>These are the standard SMT agents:
<UL>
<LI>The logging agent $(*SMTLOG) - writes data to log files.
<LI>The operator console $(*SMTOPER) - handles error messages
produced by other agents.
<LI>The timer agent $(*SMTTIME) - generates one-off or repeated
timing events.
<LI>The time-slot agent $(*SMTSLOT) - generates events
according to a set of time-slots.
<LI>The socket agent $(*SMTSOCK) - handles input and output on
sockets.
<LI>The transfer agent $(*SMTTRAN) - handles message and basic
file transfer via TCP sockets.
<LI>The TCP echo agent $(*SMTECHO) - handles the TCP echo
protocol.
<LI>The HTTP agent $(*SMTHTTP) - handles the HTTP server
protocol.
<LI>The simulation agent $(*SMTSIMU) - simulates network delays.
</UL>

<P>These agents are in development, or planned:
<UL>
<LI>The FTP agent SMTFTP - handles the FTP protocol.
<LI>The secure socket agent SMTSSL - handles input and output
using the Secure Socket Layer protocol.
<LI>The fileio agent SMTFILE - handles input and output to
sequential files, with caching.
<LI>The robust transfer protocol (RTP) agent SMTRTP - handles
robust data transfer via UDP sockets.
<LI>The zip/unzip agent SMTZIP - handles access to compressed
files using the zip standard.
</UL>

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page The Logging Agent - SMTLOG
.build anchor SMTLOG
<H3>$(TITLE)</H3>

<P>Creates log files, and writes data to the log files.  Can
handle multiple log files in parallel; each open log file is
managed by one thread.  Sends errors to the operator console
agent.

<P>To use, call $(*smtlog_init)().  This does not create any
threads. Create an unnamed thread using the thread_create()
function.  Send an OPEN or APPEND event to create the log file and
PUT events to write to the log file.  Finally, send a CLOSE event
to close the log file and terminate the log file thread.  SMTLOG
does not reply - errors are sent to the console, not the
requesting program.  It supports these methods:
<UL>
<LI>CYCLE - cycle log file if it already exists.
<LI>OPEN - create new, empty log file.
<LI>APPEND - open log file in append mode.
<LI>PUT - write line of data to log file.
<LI>PLAIN - do not timestamp logged data.
<LI>STAMP - timestamp logged data (default).
<LI>CLOSE - close log file and destroy log file thread.
</UL>

<P>Example of initialising SMTLOG:

<PRE>
/*  Static data                                                 */
static QID
    logq;                       /*  Logging agent event queue   */

    /*  In agent initialisation code                            */
    THREAD  *thread;            /*  Handle to various threads   */
    /*  Ensure that logging agent is running, else start it     */
    $(*smtlog_init) ();
    if ((thread = $(*thread_create) (SMT_LOGGING, "")) != NULL)
        logq = thread-&gt; queue-&gt; qid;   /*  Get logging queue id */
    else
        return (-1);
</PRE>

<H4>The CYCLE Method</H4>

<P>If the specified log file already exists, renames it to a file
whose name consists of the first letter of the log file name,
followed by the date in 7 positions (YYYYDDD).  If that file
name already exists, generates a unique filename.  Takes the
event body to supply the log file name; if the event body is
empty, uses the thread name instead.  If the log file name is
empty ("") or the 4-letter string "NULL", nothing is done.

<H4>The OPEN Method</H4>

<P>Creates a new, empty log file.  Takes the event body to supply
the log file name; if the event body is empty, uses the thread
name instead.  If the log file name is "" or "NULL", no file is
created, and SMTLOG discards all output.

<H4>The APPEND Method</H4>

<P>Opens an existing log file for additional output.  If the log
file does not already exist, acts like OPEN.  Takes the event body
to supply the log file name; if the event body is empty, uses the
thread name instead.

<H4>The PUT Method</H4>

<P>Takes the event body as a string, prefixes the date and time,
and writes it to the log file.

<H4>The PLAIN Method</H4>

<P>Disables time-stamping of the logged data.  Use this when you
do not want the default SMTLOG time-stamping.

<H4>The STAMP Method</H4>

<P>Enables time-stamping of the logged data.

<H4>The CLOSE Method</H4>

<P>Closes the log file and destroys the thread used to manage it.
You normally send this event when you end your program.

<P>To use SMTOPER, call $(*smtoper_init)().  This creates a single
unnamed thread automatically the first time it is called, and has
no effect thereafter.  You can then send messages to this thread.
SMTOPER does not reply.  It supports these methods:

<H4>The ALARM Method</H4>

<P>Sends a single alarm event after some specified delay.  Build
the event body using exdr_write() and the message definition
SMT_TIME_ALARM.  The event body consists of these fields (see
exdr_write() for the field types):
<UL>
<LI>[q] The delay, in days.
<LI>[q] The delay, in 1/100th seconds.
<LI>[mM] An argument block, returned with the alarm event.  This
is arbitrary data, and may be NULL.
</UL>
SMTTIME replies to an ALARM event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TIME_ALARM - the alarm went off.  The event body contains the
argument block, if any.  Decode the event body, if you need to,
using exdr_read() and the message definition SMT_TIME_REPLY.  The
body contains these fields: [mM] the argument block.
<LI>TIME_ERROR - there was an error that prevented the timer from
working.  This can be handled as a fatal error.  At present the
only cause for such an error is insufficient memory.  The event
body contains an error message.
</UL>
<P>The ALARM method implicitly does a FLUSH before proceeding.

<H4>The WAKEUP Method</H4>

<P>Sends a single alarm event at some specified day and time.
Build the event body using exdr_write() and the message definition
SMT_TIME_ALARM.  The event body consists of these fields (see
exdr_write() for the field types):
<UL>
<LI>[q] The alarm time in days.
<LI>[q] The alarm time in 1/100th seconds.
<LI>[mM] An argument block, returned with the alarm event.  This
is arbitrary data, and may be NULL.
</UL>
SMTTIME replies to a WAKEUP event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TIME_ALARM - the alarm went off.  The event body contains the
argument block, if any.  Decode the event body, if you need to,
using exdr_read() and the message definition SMT_TIME_REPLY.  The
body contains these fields: [mM] the argument block.
<LI>TIME_ERROR - there was an error that prevented the timer from
working.  This can be handled as a fatal error.  At present the
only cause for such an error is insufficient memory.  The event
body contains an error message.
</UL>
<P>The WAKEUP method implicitly does a FLUSH before proceeding.

<H4>The CLOCK Method</H4>

<P>Sends a repeated alarm event after some specified delay, for
ever, or a specific number of times.  Build the event body using
exdr_write() and the message definition SMT_TIME_CLOCK.  The event
body consists of these fields (see exdr_write() for the field
types):
<UL>
<LI>[q] The delay, in days.
<LI>[q] The delay, in 1/100th seconds.
<LI>[w] A number of times to cycle; zero means forever.
<LI>[mM] An argument block, returned with the alarm event.  This
is arbitrary data, and may be NULL.
</UL>
SMTTIME replies to a CLOCK event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TIME_ALARM - the alarm went off.  The event body contains the
argument block, if any.  Decode the event body, if you need to,
using exdr_read() and the message definition SMT_TIME_REPLY.  The

body contains an error message.
</UL>
<P>The CLOCK method implicitly does a FLUSH before proceeding.

<H4>The FLUSH Method</H4>

<P>Removes any requests sent by a particular client thread.  Use
this to cancel a CLOCK method, or an unexpired ALARM or WAKEUP

.page The Time Slot Agent - SMTSLOT
.build anchor SMTSLOT
<H3>$(TITLE)</H3>

<P>Manages 'time slots', a mechanism to allow long-running programs
to 'switch on' and 'switch off' at specific times during the day.
The time slot agent simulates a wall timer, i.e. a timer that
switches a device like a lamp or electric heater on and off during
the day.

<P>To use SMTSLOT, call $(*smtslot_init)(). This does not create
any threads. Create a named thread, then send SPECIFY events to
define the various time slots for your application.  Then send an
ON or OFF event to initialise the timer.  The time slot agent then
sends a SWITCH_ON event when the timer move to an 'ON' state, and a
SWITCH_OFF event when the timer moves to an 'OFF' state.  Errors
are sent to the console, not the requesting program.  SMTSLOT
supports these methods:
<UL>
<LI>SPECIFY - define a time slot specification.
<LI>ON - initialise timer - application is switched on.
<LI>OFF - initialise timer - application is switched off.
</UL>

<P>Example of initialising SMTSLOT:

<PRE>
/*  Static data                                                 */
static QID
    slotq;                       /*  Time slot event queue      */

    /*  In agent initialisation code                            */
    THREAD  *thread;            /*  Handle to various threads   */
    /*  Ensure that time slot agent is running, else start it   */
    $(*smtslot_init) ();
    if ((thread = $(*thread_create) (SMT_SLOT, "myprog")) != NULL)
        slotq = thread-&gt; queue-&gt; qid;
    else
        return (-1);
</PRE>

<H4>The SPECIFY Method</H4>

<P>Defines one or more time slots.  A slot specification is a
string, in the format: "name value ...".  The name field is a day
name ("mon"-"sun"), a date in MD order ("12/31") or a date in YMD
order ("95/12/31").  The value is a list of times in 24 hour
HH:MM[-HH:MM] format ("7:30-12:30 13:30-17:30 17:35").  A value
"off" clears all time slots for that day. The time slot accuracy
is SLOT_TICK csecs.  Any day that does not have specified values
is switched 'off'.  Build the event body using exdr_write() and the
message definition SMT_SLOT_SPEC.  The event body consists of these
fields (see exdr_write() for the field types):
<UL>
<LI>[s] slot specification string.
</UL>
SMTTRAN replies to a SPECIFY event with a SLOT_ERROR event if there
was an error, else it does not reply.

<H4>The ON Method</H4>

<P>Sets the timer 'ON'.  The event does not have a body.  The timer
will respond with a SWITCH_OFF event when it moves into an 'OFF'
state.

<H4>The OFF Method</H4>

<P>Sets the timer 'OFF'.  The event does not have a body.  The
timer will respond with a SWITCH_ON event when it moves into an
'ON' state.

.page The Socket I/O Agent - SMTSOCK
.build anchor SMTSOCK
<H3>$(TITLE)</H3>

<P>Handles input and output to TCP and UDP sockets. You should use
this agent for all access to TCP or UDP sockets, although you can
also access sockets directly using the SFL socket access
functions.  Socket i/o is both central to most Internet servers,
and reasonably delicate, making it a task that is well done by a
specific agent.

<P>SMTSOCK has two main functions: it acts as the central
'heartbeat' for an Internet server, and it perform input and
output on sockets.  The heartbeat function works as follows:
SMTSOCK uses the select() function to monitor all open sockets.
Each socket is owned by a thread, somewhere.  When a socket shows
signs of life, SMTSOCK sends an event to the appropriate thread.
The thread can then decide to read or write data as required.  In
a typical Internet application -- such as the XITAMI web server --
the socket agent is the main source of the events that drive the
application.  By contrast, in non-Internet applications the
'heartbeat' role could be played by the timer agent SMTTIME.

<P>The second task for SMTSOCK is input and output on sockets.
For instance, you can ask SMTSOCK to read data from a socket, or
to write a block of data to a socket.  Both these tasks can
require multiple cycles, waiting until the socket is ready, then
reading/writing as much data as possible, until all the data has
been read/written.  SMTSOCK handles this automatically.

<P>To use SMTSOCK, call $(*smtsock_init)().  This creates a single
unnamed thread automatically the first time it is called, and has
no effect thereafter.  You can then send messages to this thread.
SMTSOCK replies to most events.  It supports these methods:
<UL>
<LI>READ - read data from a socket.
<LI>READR - read data from a socket, repeatedly.
<LI>WRITE - write data to a socket.
<LI>INPUT - wait for ready for input on a socket.
<LI>INPUTR - wait for ready for input on a socket, repeatedly.
<LI>OUTPUT - wait for ready for output on a socket.
<LI>CONNECT - make connection to specified host and port.
<LI>FLUSH - cancel any requests on a socket.
</UL>

<P>Example of initialising SMTSOCK:

<PRE>
/*  Static data                                                 */
static QID
    sockq;                      /*  Socket agent event queue    */

    /*  In agent initialisation code                            */
    THREAD  *thread;            /*  Handle to various threads   */

    /*  Reply events from socket agent                          */
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOCK_INPUT_OK",  ok_event,       0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOCK_OUTPUT_OK", ok_event,       0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOCK_READ_OK",   read_ok_event,  0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOCK_WRITE_OK",  write_ok_event, 0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOCK_CLOSED",    closed_event,   0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOCK_ERROR",     error_event,    0);
    $(*method_declare) (agent, "SOCK_TIMEOUT",   error_event,    0);

    /*  Ensure that socket agent is running, else start it      */
    $(*smtsock_init) ();
    if ((thread = $(*thread_lookup) (SMT_SOCKET, "")) != NULL)
        sockq = thread-&gt; queue-&gt; qid;
    else
        return (-1);
</PRE>

<H4>The READ Method</H4>

<P>Waits for, and reads data from a socket.  TCP/IP breaks a
stream of data into chunks of arbitrary size, and each low-level
read operation will read one such chunk.  Thus, to read a specific
amount of data, you may need to make several low-level read calls.
SMTSOCK packages this so that one READ event can read as much data
as required.  You can alternatively ask SMTSOCK to read just the
next chunk sent by TCP/IP.  Build the event body using
exdr_write() and the message definition SMT_SOCK_READ.  The event
body consists of these fields (see exdr_write() for the field
types):
<UL>
<LI>[d] A timeout, in seconds.  After this timeout, the read
request will be cancelled.  If zero, no timeout is applied.  Note
that this is not the same type of timeout as that you can specify
in $(*event_send)().
<LI>[q] The socket to read from.  The socket must be opened and
connected.
<LI>[d] The size of the receiving buffer.  The buffer is allocated
by SMTSOCK, and can be any size up to (almost) 64K bytes.  This is
the maximum size of the returned data.
<LI>[d] The minimum amount of data to read, which can be a value
from one up to the full buffer size.  If zero, the full buffer
must be read.
<LI>[q] A user-defined request tag; this is an arbitrary token
that is returned with reply events.
</UL>
SMTSOCK replies to a READ event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>SOCK_READ_OK - data was read successfully.  Decode the event
body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_READ_OK. The body contains these fields: [d] timeout in
seconds from read request; [q] the socket specified for i/o; [mM]
a block of memory containing the read data; [q] the user-defined
request tag.  The SMT_SOCK_READ_OK message maps exactly to a
SMT_SOCK_WRITE message, so that you can perform an 'echo' simply
by returning the event to SMTSOCK.
<LI>SOCK_CLOSED - the socket was closed by the peer.  Data may or
may not have been read.  Decode the event as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_TIMEOUT - the read request timed-out.  Data may or may
not have been read.  Decode the event as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  Any data read
is discarded.  Decode the event body using exdr_read() and the
message definition SMT_SOCK_ERROR.  The body contains these
fields: [s] a string containing the error message, [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [q] the user-defined request tag.
</UL>

<H4>The READR Method</H4>

<P>Works in the same way as the READ method, but works repeatedly
until a FLUSH is sent for the socket.  The READR method is useful
for servers that have to loop on reading a socket; it saves the
need for sending fresh READ events.

<H4>The WRITE Method</H4>

<P>Writes a block of data to a socket.  If you call the low-level
TCP/IP write function directly, you must handle various error and
retry conditions.  It is easier and safer to use SMTSOCK to do
this.  Build the event body using exdr_write() and the message
definition SMT_SOCK_WRITE.  The event body consists of these
fields:
<UL>
<LI>[d] A timeout, in seconds.  After this timeout, the write
request will be cancelled.  If zero, no timeout is applied.
<LI>[q] The socket to write to.  The socket must be opened and
connected.
<LI>[mM] The block of data to write, specified as a length and
memory address.
<LI>[q] A user-defined request tag; this is an arbitrary token
that is returned with reply events.
</UL>
SMTSOCK replies to a WRITE event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>SOCK_WRITE_OK - data was written successfully.  Decode the
event body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_OK. The body contains these fields: [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [q] the user-defined request tag.
<LI>SOCK_CLOSED - the socket was closed by the peer.  Data may or
may not have been written.  Decode the event as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_TIMEOUT - the write request timed-out.  Data may or may
not have been written.  Decode the event as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  Data may or
may not have been written.  Decode the event body using
exdr_read() and the message definition SMT_SOCK_ERROR.  The body
contains these fields: [q] the socket specified for i/o; [s] a
string containing the error message; [q] the user-defined request
tag.
</UL>

<H4>The INPUT Method</H4>

<P>Waits for input to arrive on a socket.  This can be data, or a
connection request.  Build the event body using exdr_write() and
the message definition SMT_SOCK_INPUT.  The event body consists of
these fields:
<UL>
<LI>[d] A timeout, in seconds.  After this timeout, the input
request will be cancelled.  If zero, no timeout is applied.
<LI>[q] The socket to wait on.  The socket must be opened and
ready.
<LI>[q] A user-defined request tag; this is an arbitrary token
that is returned with reply events.
</UL>
SMTSOCK replies to an INPUT event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>SOCK_INPUT_OK - data is waiting on the socket.  Decode the
event body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_OK. The body contains these fields: [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [q] the user-defined request tag.
<LI>SOCK_CLOSED - the socket was closed by the peer.  Decode the
event as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_TIMEOUT - the input request timed-out.  Decode the event
as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  Decode the
event body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_ERROR.  The body contains these fields: [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [s] a string containing the error message; [q]
the user-defined request tag.
</UL>

<H4>The INPUTR Method</H4>

<P>Works in the same way as the INPUT method, but works repeatedly
until a FLUSH is sent for the socket.  The INPUTR method is useful
for servers that have to loop on waiting for a socket; it saves
the need for sending fresh INPUT events.

<H4>The OUTPUT Method</H4>

<P>Waits for a socket to be ready for output.  If you use the low-
level TCP/IP write functions, you must be sure that the socket is
ready for output, or your thread will block the entire application
if it has to wait.  Build the event body using exdr_write() and
the message definition SMT_SOCK_OUTPUT.  The event body consists
of these fields:
<UL>
<LI>[d] A timeout, in seconds.  After this timeout, the output
request will be cancelled.  If zero, no timeout is applied.
<LI>[q] The socket to wait on.  The socket must be opened and
ready.
<LI>[q] A user-defined request tag; this is an arbitrary token
that is returned with reply events.
</UL>
SMTSOCK replies to an OUTPUT event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>SOCK_OUTPUT_OK - the socket is ready to receive data.  Decode
the event body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_OK. The body contains these fields: [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [q] the user-defined request tag.
<LI>SOCK_CLOSED - the socket was closed by the peer.  Decode the
event as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_TIMEOUT - the output request timed-out.  Decode the event
as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  Decode the
event body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_ERROR.  The body contains these fields: [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [s] a string containing the error message; [q]
the user-defined request tag.
</UL>

<H4>The CONNECT Method</H4>

<P>Establishes a TCP or UDP connection to some specified host and
service (or port).  Build the event body using exdr_write() and
the message definition SMT_SOCK_CONNECT.  The event body consists
of these fields:
<UL>
<LI>[d] A timeout, in seconds.  After this timeout, the output
request will be cancelled.  If zero, no timeout is applied.
<LI>[s] The type of connection wanted: "UDP" or "TCP".
<LI>[s] The host system to connect to, specified as a name or a
dotted address string, or NULL, meaning the current system.
<LI>[s] The service to connect to, as a service name or a port
number in ASCII, or NULL, meaning use the binary port/address
information below.
<LI>[d] A 16-bit host port, or 0.
<LI>[q] A 32-bit host address, or 0.  You can supply either these
two values, or the host/service strings.  The binary port/address
data will form a connection faster.
<LI>[q] A user-defined request tag; this is an arbitrary token
that is returned with reply events.
</UL>
SMTSOCK replies to a CONNECT event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>SOCK_OUTPUT_OK - the socket is ready for receiving data.
Decode the event body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_OK. The body contains these fields: [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [q] the user-defined request tag.
<LI>SOCK_CLOSED - the socket was closed by the peer.  Decode the
event as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_TIMEOUT - the output request timed-out.  Decode the event
as for SOCK_READ_OK.
<LI>SOCK_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  Decode the
event body using exdr_read() and the message definition
SMT_SOCK_ERROR.  The body contains these fields: [q] the socket
specified for i/o; [s] a string containing the error message; [q]
the user-defined request tag.
</UL>

<H4>The FLUSH Method</H4>

<P>Removes any requests for a socket.  Since events are delivered
in a straight first-in first-out basis (ignoring the high priority
SHUTDOWN event) it is safe to send first a FLUSH event, followed
by another event, with no intervening wait.  Build the event body
using exdr_write() and the message definition SMT_SOCK_FLUSH.  The
event body consists of these fields:
<UL>
<LI>[q] The socket to flush; all pending requests on this socket
are removed without further feedback.
</UL>
SMTSOCK does not reply to a FLUSH event.

<H4>Example Of Use</H4>

<P>The $(*SMTECHO) agent provides a good basic example of using
$(*SMTSOCK).  Study this program, and use it as a basis for your
own socket-based agents.

<H4>Notes and Comments</H4>
<P>The SOCK_CLOSED and SOCK_TIMEOUT return events can come from
various requests; to make processing of this possible, they are
always formatted as SOCK_READ_OK events.

.page The Transfer Agent - SMTTRAN
.build anchor SMTTRAN
<H3>$(TITLE)</H3>

<P>Transfers blocks of data or files to connected sockets.  You
can use this agent to simplify certain types of communication.
The transfer agent uses the socket agent for actual reading and
writing to sockets.

<P>To use SMTTRAN, call $(*smttran_init)().  This creates a single
unnamed thread automatically the first time it is called, and has
no effect thereafter.  You can then send messages to this thread.
It supports these methods:
<UL>
<LI>PUT_BLOCK - writes a length-specified block to a socket.
<LI>GET_BLOCK - reads a length-specified block from a socket.
<LI>PUT_FILE - writes an entire file to a socket.
<LI>GET_FILE - reads an entire file from a socket.
<LI>COMMIT - wait until all outstanding requests are
complete.
</UL>

<P>Example of initialising SMTTRAN:

<PRE>
/*  Static data                                                 */
static QID
    tranq;                      /*  Transfer agent queue        */

    /*  In agent initialisation code                            */
    THREAD  *thread;            /*  Handle to console thread    */
    /*  Ensure that transfer agent is running, else start it    */
    $(*smttran_init) ();
    if ((thread = $(*thread_lookup) (SMT_TRANSFER, "")) != NULL)
        tranq = thread-&gt; queue-&gt; qid;
    else
        return (-1);
</PRE>

<H4>The PUT_BLOCK Method</H4>

<P>Writes a length-specified block to a socket: first writes a
two-byte length specifier in network format, then writes the block
data.  Build the event body using exdr_write() and the message
definition SMT_TRAN_PUTB.  The event body consists of these fields
(see exdr_write() for the field types):
<UL>
<LI>[q] socket to use for output.
<LI>[mM] block of data to write to socket.
</UL>
SMTTRAN replies to a PUT_BLOCK event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TRAN_PUT_OK - the block was completely written to the socket.
The event body contains the amount of data written.  Decode the
event body, if you need to, using exdr_read() and the message
definition SMT_TRAN_PUTB_OK.  The body contains these fields: [d]
the size of the block.
<LI>TRAN_CLOSED - the socket was closed before the block could be
completely written.  The event body is empty.
<LI>TRAN_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  The event body
contains the socket error message text.
</UL>

<H4>The GET_BLOCK Method</H4>

<P>Reads a length-specified block from a socket: first reads a
two-byte length specifier in network format, then reads that many
bytes of block data.  Build the event body using exdr_write() and
the message definition SMT_TRAN_GETB.  The event body consists of
these fields (see exdr_write() for the field types):
<UL>
<LI>[q] socket to use for input.
</UL>
SMTTRAN replies to a GET_BLOCK event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TRAN_GET_OK - the block was completely read from the socket.
The event body contains the data block.  Decode the event body
using exdr_read() and the message definition SMT_TRAN_GETB_OK.
The body contains these fields: [mM] the data block.
<LI>TRAN_CLOSED - the socket was closed before the block could be
completely read.  The event body is empty.
<LI>TRAN_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  The event body
contains the socket error message text.
</UL>

<H4>The PUT_FILE Method</H4>

<P>Writes a file to a socket: reads the file in pieces of
unspecified size, and writes these to the output socket.  Build
the event body using exdr_write() and the message definition
SMT_TRAN_PUTF.  The event body consists of these fields (see
exdr_write() for the field types):
<UL>
<LI>[q] socket to use for output.
<LI>[s] name of file to write to socket.
</UL>
SMTTRAN replies to a PUT_FILE event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TRAN_PUT_OK - the file was completely written to the socket.
The event body contains the amount of data written.  Decode the
event body, if you need to, using exdr_read() and the message
definition SMT_TRAN_PUTF_OK.  The body contains these fields: [q]
the size of the file.
<LI>TRAN_CLOSED - the socket was closed before the file could be
completely written.  The event body is empty.
<LI>TRAN_ERROR - there was an error on the socket or accessing the
file.  The event body contains the socket or file error message
text.
</UL>

<H4>The GET_FILE Method</H4>

<P>Reads a file from a socket and saves it with the specified
name.  Build the event body using exdr_write() and the message
definition SMT_TRAN_GETF.  The event body consists of these fields
(see exdr_write() for the field types):
<UL>
<LI>[q] socket to use for input.
<LI>[s] name of file to create.
</UL>
SMTTRAN replies to a GET_FILE event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TRAN_GET_OK - the file was completely read from the socket.
The event body contains the amount of data written.  Decode the
event body, if you need to, using exdr_read() and the message
definition SMT_TRAN_GETF_OK.  The body contains these fields: [q]
the size of the file.
<LI>TRAN_CLOSED - the socket was closed before the file could be
completely read.  The event body is empty.
<LI>TRAN_ERROR - there was an error on the socket or accessing the
file.  The event body contains the socket or file error message
text.
</UL>

<H4>The COMMIT Method</H4>

<P>Waits until all put and get requests are finished, then replies
with a TRAN_CLOSED event.  This event does not take any arguments.
SMTTRAN replies to a GET_FILE event with one of these events:
<UL>
<LI>TRAN_CLOSED - no requests remain.  The event body is
empty.
<LI>TRAN_ERROR - there was an error on the socket.  The event body
contains the socket error message text.
</UL>

<H3>$(TITLE)</H3>

<P>Provides the TCP echo service on port 7.

<P>To use SMTECHO, call $(*smtecho_init)().  This initialises the
echo service on TCP port 7.  If you set the global variable
ip_portbase to some value before initialising SMTECHO, the echo
port is moved by that value.  For instance, if you set ip_portbase
to 8000, the echo port is 8007.  This lets you run the service in
'user space': on most systems you need root access to use ports
below 1000.

<P>Provides the HTTP service on port 80.

<P>To use SMTHTTP, call $(*smthttp_init)().  This initialises the
HTTP service on TCP port 80.  If you set the global variable
ip_portbase to some value before initialising SMTHTTP, the HTTP
port is moved by that value.  For instance, if you set ip_portbase
to 8000, the HTTP port is 8080.  This lets you run the service in
'user space': on most systems you need root access to use ports
below 1000.

<P>To connect to a webserver running on some system at port 8080,
use this URL: <TT>http://hostname:8080/</TT>.

<P>The current implementation of SMTHTTP is quite sophisticated.
It will look for <TT>default.htm</TT>, <TT>default.html</TT>,
<TT>index.htm</TT>, <TT>index.html</TT> in that order if no
filename is specified.  The file <TT>smthttp.aut</TT> defines
directories that are protected by username/password definitions.

.page The Unattended Process Monitor (UPM) Tool
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>The UPM tool is a small application developed with SMT, and
included as an example.  The UPM tool was developed on UNIX and may
not be very useful on other systems.

<P>The UPM tool allows you to manage 'unattended' processes, which
may handle input/output on some devices, typically terminals.  The
UPM tool lets you start and stop such processes, manually or using
a timer.

<H3>Technical Details</H3>

<P>The UPM tool consists of four programs:
<OL>
<LI><TT>upmd</TT> is a server program that runs permanently.
<LI><TT>upmc</TT> is a client program that provides a command-level
interface.
<LI><TT>smtupmd</TT> is an agent that handles the UPM server
protocol.  The <TT>upmd</TT> program is basically a wrapper around
this agent.
<LI><TT>smtupmc</TT> is an agent that handles the UPM client
protocol.  The <TT>upmc</TT> program is basically a wrapper around
this agent.
</OL>

<P>The main UPM configuration file is called "upm.ini".  This is
a typical "upm.ini" file:
</PRE>[Setup]
    logfile=upmd.log
[Tasks]
    name=task1
    name=task2
</PRE>

<P>The [Tasks] section defines each of the UPM tasks.  Each task
has a config file to define task-specific values. The config file
for "task1" is called "TASK1.ini". For example:
<PRE>#   Configuration for Task 1
[Setup]
    stdin=/dev/pts/1
    stdout=/dev/pts/1
    stderr=/dev/pts/1
[Environment]
    DATABASE=test
    PRINTER=tcp://localhost:1000
[Run]
    idle=banner IDLE
    startup=run BBORNE.gnt
    cancel=cleanup
</PRE>

<P>The [Setup] section defines the input/output devices for the
task.  The [Environment] section defines a list of variables for
the task.  The [Run] section defines the idle command and the
startup command.  These commands must be executable files (scripts
or programs) with optional arguments.  Redirection or multiple
commands are not permitted.

<P>Each task also has an optional TIMES file.  The times file for
task1 is called "TASK1.tim", and looks something like this:
<PRE>#  This file specifies the times for Task1

mon 8-12 12:30-20
tue 8-12 12:30-20
wed 8-12 12:30-20
thu 8-12 13:05-13:06  13:08:13-10
fri 8-12 12:30-20
12/25 off
1/1 off
</PRE>

<P>Each line (except blank lines and comments) defines some times
for a day.  The first word on the line is the <EM>day</EM>, the
remaining words are one or more time <EM>specifications</EM>.  A
day can be:
<UL>
<LI>A day name, Mon-Sun.
<LI>A date, MM/DD or YY/MM/DD or YYYY/MM/DD.  If you use YY/MM/DD,
the century is assumed to be 20 for years higher than 50.
</UL>
A time specification can be:
<UL>
<LI>'off', meaning clear all times for that day.
<LI>hh:mm-hh:mm, meaning activate for that time range, inclusive.
</UL>

<P>If no TIMES file is provided, you can (or rather, must) start
and stop the tasks manually.

<H3>Using The UPM Tool</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Define the upm.ini and task .ini files correctly.  Make sure
that the devices exist and are writable.
<LI>For testing, run the <TT>upmd</TT> program in a shell window.
For real life use, place into the system startup procedure
(<TT>inittab</TT> on a UNIX system).  You can run <TT>upmd</TT> in
the background like this (assuming a UNIX system):

<PRE>nohup upmd&
</PRE>

<P>Run the command <TT>upmc</TT> to start the BORMAN client.  The
<TT>upmc<TT> program acts as a 'front-end' for the upmd daemon.
Since the daemon runs as a process in the background, it cannot
read commands from the keyboard itself.

<P>When you run <TT>upmc<TT> you get a message like this:
<PRE>upmc> 100- Connecting to UPM daemon...
upmc> 102- Connected to UPM daemon version 1.0
upmc></PRE>

<P>You can give various commands at the prompt.  This is what the
'help' command shows:
<PRE>upmc> help
Commands and arguments can be in any case.  Commands are:
LIST                 - list all known tasks
START [task | ALL]   - start specified task (default all)
STOP [task | ALL]    - stop specified task (default all)
STATUS [task | ALL]  - show status for specified task (default all)
HALT                 - halt UPM daemon
EXIT                 - end this UPM client session
QUIT                 - end this UPM client session
HELP                 - show this information
VERSION              - show UPM client version
</PRE>

<P>If you run <TT>upmc<TT> when the <TT>upmd<TT> daemon is not
running, you get this:
<PRE>upmc> 100- Connecting to UPM daemon...
upmc> 301- UPD daemon connection failed: Connection refused
</PRE>

<P>You can also run <TT>upmc<TT> to execute a command directly:
<PRE>$ upmc start all
</PRE>
Which is the same as typing this:
<PRE>$ upmc start
</PRE>

<H3>UPM Trouble Shooting</H3>

<P>These are some possible errors:
<UL>
<LI>The device you specified in the task .ini file is not
accessible to the upm daemon.  You will get an error message in the
daemon log file, or in the shell window where you ran
<TT>upmd</TT>.
<LI>The commands you specified in the task .ini file are not found
or not accessible.  You will get an error message in the daemon log
file, or in the shell window where you ran <TT>upmd<TT>.
</UL>

.page Installing The SMT Kernel
.build anchor download

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Availability and Distribution</H3>

<P>We supply the SMT kernel as two archives: a source kit and a
documentation kit (in HTML).  These files are available for
download by HTTP from our $(*imatix=website) on a permanent basis.
You need to recompile the SMT for your specific system, using an
ANSI C compiler.  We don't provide binary kits.

<P>To install and use the SMT kernel you must first install the
$(*sfl=SFL package).  SMT requires the current version of the
SFL.  To write SMT programs you also need to install the
$(*lr=Libero) tool.

<H4>Getting The Source Archive</H3>

<P>The SMT source archive is supplied as a $(*smtsrc.zip=zip file)
and a $(*smtsrc.tgz=GNU gzipped tar file).  Note that the zipped files
are in MS-DOS format (carriage-return, linefeed) while the gzip+tar
file is in UNIX format (linefeed only).  The unzip command allows
you to extract correctly for the system you are running on.
These are the files in the /pub/smt/src directory:
.build dir /pub/smt/src

<P>If you have trouble accessing the iMatix site, send us an
$(*info=e-mail) and we'll send you the SMT archives by return
e-mail.

<H4>Getting The The Documentation Kit</H3>

<P>The SMT documentation is supplied as HTML files, available
on-line or off-line as a $(*smtdoc.zip=single .zip file) that
you can install on a hard disk for rapid access, and also as
a $(*smtdoc.tgz=gzipped tar file).  These are the files in the
/pub/smt/doc directory:
.build dir /pub/smt/doc

<P>We recommend that you unzip or gunzip/detar the documentation
archive into a subdirectory.  Then, point your browser at the
<TT>index.htm</TT> file to access the documentation.  We use
relative addressing in all HTML documents, so that links work just
as well on a local hard-disk (without a web server) as on-line on
our website.  In a windowing environment is it easy and useful to
create an icon that launches a Web browser on this file.

<H3>Installation for UNIX Systems</H3>

<P>To install the SMT kernel on a UNIX system you need to:
<OL>
<LI>Install the $(*sfl=SFL package): you will want to place
<TT>libsfl.a</TT> and <TT>sfl.h</TT> in the current directory.

<LI>Download the SMT source archive and decompress it.
<LI>Run the 'build' script to compile the SMT sources and build
the libsmt.a archive file and various executables.
</OL>

<H4>Decompressing The Source Archive</H4>

<P>To unzip the $(*smtsrc.zip=source .zip file), you need the Infozip
$(*info-zip=unzip) tool:
<PRE>$ mkdir temp
$ mv smtsrc$(version_no).zip temp
$ cd temp
$ unzip -a smtsrc$(version_no)
</PRE>

<P>To decompress the $(*smtsrc.tgz=source archive) you need GNU gzip/gunzip
and tar:
<PRE>$ mkdir temp
$ mv smtsrc$(version_no).tgz temp
$ cd temp
$ gzip -d smtsrc$(version_no).tgz
  or
$ gunzip smtsrc$(version_no).tgz
$ tar -xvf smtsrc$(version_no).tar
</PRE>

<P>You can also, in extreme cases, unzip the files on a PC and
transfer the individual files to the UNIX system.

<H4>Compiling The SMT Sources</H4>

<P>To compile the SMT sources, use this command:
<PRE>$ chmod +x build
$ build
</PRE>

<P>If you get warnings or error messages, this is usually a bad
sign.  Some compilers issue warnings just because you ask for ANSI
compilation.  If you get any other error messages, please let us
know.

<P>The SMT source archive includes a script, <TT><B>c</B></TT>,
that you can (and should) use to compile an individual SMT source.
This script invokes the ANSI C compiler to produce an object code
file. It detects the platform and invokes the compiler with the
necessary switches for ANSI C compilation.  On some systems this
is the normal behaviour for the <B>cc</B> command.  On other
systems it is not normal.  You should make the <TT>c</TT> script
executable, (preferrably) install it in a shared directory like
/usr/local/bin, and try it out:
<PRE>$ chmod a+rx c
$ mv c /usr/local/bin
$ c
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>c</TT> script is also included in the SFL package.

<H3>Installation for Digital VMS Systems</H3>

<P>SMT has not been tested on Digital VMS systems.  However, it
should be portable, especially to later versions of VMS that are
POSIX compliant.  To install the SMT on a Digital VMS system you
need to:
<OL>
<LI>Install the SFL package: you will want to place
<TT>libsfl.olb</TT> and <TT>sfl.h</TT> in the current
directory.
<LI>Download the source archive and decompress it.
<LI>Run the 'build.txt' command file to build the libsmt.olb
library file and the various executables.
</OL>

<H4>Decompressing The Source Archive</H4>

<P>To unzip the $(*smtsrc.zip=source .zip file), you need the Infozip
$(*info-zip=unzip) tool:
<PRE>$ create/dir [.temp]
$ ren smtsrc$(version_no).zip [.temp]
$ set def [.temp]
$ unzip -a smtsrc$(version_no)
</PRE>

<P>You can also, in extreme cases, unzip the files on a PC and
transfer the individual files to the VMS system.

<H4>Compiling The SMT Sources</H4>

<P>To compile the SMT sources, use this command:
<PRE>$ @build.txt
</PRE>

<P>Note: this command file has not yet been tested, so it would be
a little surprising if it worked.  Nonetheless, the work it does
is simple: compile all .c programs, then link a couple of main
programs.  If you get warnings or error messages, this is a bad
sign - please let us know.

<H3>Installation for Windows</H3>

<P>Our preferred way of working is to build the SFL as a static
library, and do the same for the SMT kernel.  Using a typical
Windows-hosted compiler, we create two projects.  Then, we create a
project for each main program.  For instance, we create a project
each for the echod and echocli programs.  In these projects, we
refer to the SFL and SMT library files.  While the SFL and SMT
libraries compile fine under 16-bit Windows, the link phase usually
gives problems, and we prefer to work with a 32-bit memory model.
All SMT programs, including the Xitami web server, run as 32-bit
console processes under Windows NT and 95.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page System-Specific Concerns
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>This section notes constraints that we've come across on
various systems.  This is not meant to be a complete list of all
possible problems.

<H3>Windows</H3>

<H4>SMTSOCK and the select() call</H4>

<P>SMTSOCK uses the select() call to wait for socket events.  On
UNIX systems, select() returns when the process receives a signal.
We use this fact to implement the process timer, SMTTIME, in an
application that may also be doing socket i/o.

<P>Under Windows 95, however, the select() call does not unblock
when a signal is sent.  The winsock call WSACancelBlockingCall()
is meant to unblock the select() call.  This does not work under
Windows 95, at least.  (WSAIsBlocking() always reports FALSE.)

<P>The consequence of this is that the timeout specified in the
select() call makes a difference to the way that the timer work.
If we use a 1-second timeout, for instance, we find that timer
events are also limited to a resolution of 1 second.  This makes
it difficult to use timer events for real-time work in socket
based applications.

<P>This appears to be a bug in the Windows 95 winsock.dll; it
may also affect Windows NT.

<P>Our solution is to use WSACancelBlockingCall() in any case,
should the winsock.dll support it correctly.  Secondly, under
Windows, we reduce the select() timeout from 1 second to 1/5th
of a second.  On other systems - UNIX, OS/2 - we use 1 second,
so that the application uses minimal system resources.
