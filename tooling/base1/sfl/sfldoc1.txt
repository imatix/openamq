<P>The SFL (Standard Function Library) from iMatix is a portable function
library for C/C++ programs. The SFL is the result of many years'
development, and is provided as Open Source software for the benefit of the
Internet community.

<P>You may want to go straight to the $(*TOC=Table of Contents).
.if $(superdoc?0) == 0
Also, this documentation is available as a single compressed
$(*sflbig.zip=zip file) or $(*sflbig.tgz=gzipped tar file), suitable for printing.

.page What Is The SFL
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Origins</H3>

<P>At iMatix we develop portable free and commercial software. We work in
ANSI C to cover the widest range possible. A major part of our toolkit has
always been our subroutine library. This was initially written for MS-DOS in
1991 but has developed into a more ambitious project since then.

<P>From the outset, we ignored commercial libraries. Our software is usually
Open Source and using a commercial library would have been a problem. We
looked for free libraries, but found only specialised and mostly
non-portable collections of functions. So, we built our own. We hope you
like it. We certainly use it all the time.

<H3>Objectives</H3>

<P>When we designed the SFL, we had certain things in mind:

<UL>
<LI>Portability: we are lazy, and don't have much time. So, we want to do
our editing and testing on the fastest PC possible, then move the results to
a 'real' system (UNIX, VMS, whatever) recompile, and test. Obviously, some
code cannot be tested fully on all systems - we don't have sockets under
MS-DOS - but this approach works for most projects. The SFL
<EM>encapsulates</EM> non-portable aspects so that application programs do
not need to know about specific systems.

<LI>Building servers, i.e. programs that run in the background, for a long
time, without intervention from a user or operator. Servers have specific
needs, and must be extremely robust, since they must run for long periods.
The SFL provides many functions that are specifically meant for this type of
program.

<LI>Functionality: the classic purpose of any library. If a problem has a
clean, tested, documented, and portable solution, we will use that instead
of re-inventing it. The SFL provides a stable home for code that might
otherwise float around in various projects.

<LI>Discipline: we make our code public, and expect people to read it. We
actually include the code for each function as part of its documentation.
This forces us to be crystal clear.

<LI>Hubris: we think our code is so great that it should live for ever. So,
we take great pains to make it useful, clean, efficient, and well-packaged,
so you'll think so too.
</UL>

<H3>Portability</H3>

<P>The SFL is in use on at least these systems:
<UL>
<LI>MS-Windows (MSVC, Borland, Watcom, gcc)
<LI>MS-DOS (MSVC, Borland Turbo-C)
<LI>OS/2 (EMX)
<LI>Linux
<LI>IBM RS/6000 AIX
<LI>Sun SunOS
<LI>Sun Solaris
<LI>HP HP/UX
<LI>Digital UNIX
<LI>FreeBSD
<LI>NetBSD
<LI>SCO OpenServer
<LI>SCO UnixWare
<LI>Digital OpenVMS
</UL>

<P>Some recent functions may not have been tested or implemented across all
platforms. Some functions are empty on some platforms. Since the SFL is
continually improving and enlarging, there are always newer functions that
are less tested, and possibly less than 100% portable. Our intention is that
the transparency of the SFL makes these functions easy to test and improve.

.-----------------------------------------------------------------
.page Installing The SFL
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Availability and Distribution</H3>

<P>We supply the SFL as two archives: a source kit and a documentation kit
(in HTML). These files are available for download by HTTP from our
$(*imatix=website) on a permanent basis. You need to recompile the SFL for
your specific system, using an ANSI C compiler. We don't provide binary kits
for several reasons:
<UL>
<LI>With one source archive and one documentation archive, the
SFL is easier to distribute.
<LI>The SFL changes rapidly - a source distribution is simpler.
<LI>You can pick and choose the functions you want.
<LI>The sources are the primary source of documentation.
<LI>The license terms are such that the sources must be supplied
or be available in any case.
</UL>

<H4>Getting The Source Archive</H4>

<P>The SFL source archive is supplied as a $(*sflsrc.zip=zip file)
and a $(*sflsrc.tgz=GNU gzipped tar file).  These are the files in
the /pub/sfl/src directory:
.build dir /pub/sfl/src

<P>If you have trouble accessing the iMatix site, send us an
$(*info=e-mail) and we'll send you the SFL archives by return
e-mail.

<H4>Getting The The Documentation Kit</H4>

<P>The SFL documentation is supplied as HTML files, available on-line or
off-line as a $(*sfldoc.zip=single .zip file) that you can install on a hard
disk for rapid access, and also as a $(*sfldoc.tgz=gzipped tar file).
These are the files in the /pub/sfl/doc directory:
.build dir /pub/sfl/doc

<P>We recommend that you unzip or gunzip/detar the archive into a
subdirectory.  Point your browser at the <TT>index.htm</TT> file.
We use relative addressing in all HTML documents, so that links
work just as well on a local hard-disk as on-line on our website.
In a windowing environment is it easy and useful to create an icon
that runs a Web browser on this file.

<HR>
<H3>Installation for UNIX Systems</H3>

<P>To install the SFL on a UNIX system you need to:
<OL>
<LI>Download the source archive and decompress it.
<LI>Run the 'build' script to compile the SFL sources and build
the libsfl.a archive file.
<LI>Optionally, install the libsfl.a file in the /usr/lib
directory.
<LI>Optionally, install the SFL header file(s) in the /usr/include
directory.
</OL>

<H4>Decompressing The Source Archive</H4>

<P>To unzip the $(*sflsrc.zip=source .zip file), you need the Infozip
$(*info-zip=unzip) tool:
<PRE>$ mkdir temp
$ mv sflsrc$(version_no).zip temp
$ cd temp
$ unzip -a sflsrc$(version_no)
</PRE>

<P>To decompress the $(*sflsrc.tgz=source archive) you need GNU
gzip/gunzip and tar:
<PRE>$ mkdir temp
$ mv sflsrc$(version_no).tgz temp
$ cd temp
$ gzip -d sflsrc$(version_no).tgz
  or
$ gunzip sflsrc$(version_no).tgz
$ tar -xvf sflsrc$(version_no).tar
</PRE>

<P>You can also, in extreme cases, unzip the files on a PC and
transfer the individual files to the UNIX system.

<H4>Compiling The SFL Sources</H4>

<P>The SFL source archive includes a script, <TT><B>c</B></TT>,
that you can (and should) use to compile the SFL sources.  This
script invokes the ANSI C compiler to produce an object code file.
It detects the platform and invokes the compiler with the
necessary switches for ANSI C compilation.  On some systems this
is the normal behaviour for the <B>cc</B> command.  On other
systems it is not normal.  You should make the <TT>c</TT> script
executable, (preferrably) install it in a shared directory like
/usr/local/bin, and try it out:
<PRE>$ chmod a+rx c
$ mv c /usr/local/bin
$ c
</PRE>

<P>To compile the SFL sources, use this command:
<PRE>$ chmod +x build
$ ./build
</PRE>

<P>If you get warnings or error messages, this is usually a bad
sign.  Some compilers issue warnings just because you ask for ANSI
compilation.  If you get any other error messages, please let us
know.

<P>You can use individual SFL files simply by specifying them on
the command line when you compile and link a program.  However,
this is usually a pain.  Therefore, the build script creates a
library file called libsfl.a.  The linker can automatically search
this file for the SFL functions.  To install libsfl.a in the
/usr/lib directory, do this:
<PRE>$ mv libsfl.a /usr/lib
</PRE>

<H4>Using The SFL In Your Applications</H4>

<P>To use an SFL function in your applications you must include a
header file that defines the structures, prototypes, and types for
the function API.  The SFL provides three types of header
files:
<OL>
<LI>One header file per function group.  These are provided for
reference; you will normally not use these directly.
<LI>A $(*uhf=Universal Header File) which encapsulates and
replaces all local header files.  Again, this is provided for
reference; you do not normally use this directly.
<LI>A $(*lhf=Library Header File) that contains the Universal
Header File and all the SFL header files in one go.  This is meant
to simplify application programming and installation.
</OL>

<P>We recommend that you install the <TT>sfl.h</TT> file in
/usr/include.  A typical application program starts like this:
<PRE>#include &lt;sfl.h&gt;
</PRE>

<P>To link an application program, use the <TT>c -l</TT> command.
This assumes that libsfl.a is installed /usr/lib.

<HR>
<H3>Installation for Digital VMS Systems</H3>

<P>To install the SFL on a Digital VMS system you need to:
<OL>
<LI>Download the source archive and decompress it.
<LI>Run the 'build.txt' command file to build the libsfl.olb
library file.
<LI>Optionally, install the libsfl.olb file in the SYS$LIBRARY
directory.
<LI>Optionally, install the SFL header file(s) in the SYS$LIBRARY
directory.
</OL>

<H4>Decompressing The Source Archive</H4>

<P>To unzip the $(*sflsrc.zip=source .zip file), you need the Infozip
$(*info-zip=unzip) tool (note that you need the -a switch):
<PRE>$ create/dir [.temp]
$ ren sflsrc$(version_no).zip [.temp]
$ set def [.temp]
$ unzip -a sflsrc$(version_no)
</PRE>

<P>You can also, in extreme cases, unzip the files on a PC and
transfer the individual files to the VMS system.

<H4>Compiling The SFL Sources</H4>

<P>To compile the SFL sources, use this command:
<PRE>$ @build.txt
</PRE>

<P>If you get warnings or error messages, this is a bad sign -
please let us know.

<P>The build.txt command file creates a library file called
libsfl.olb.  You can install this in a central directory like
SYS$LIBRARY if you wish.  You'll need system privileges to do
this.

<H4>Using The SFL In Your Applications</H4>

<P>To use an SFL function in your applications you must include a
header file that defines the structures, prototypes, and types for
the function API.  The SFL provides three types of header
files:
<OL>
<LI>One header file per function group.  These are provided for
reference; you will normally not use these directly.
<LI>A $(*uhf=Universal Header File) which encapsulates and
replaces all local header files.  Again, this is provided for
reference; you do not normally use this directly.
<LI>A $(*lhf=Library Header File) that contains the Universal
Header File and all the SFL header files in one go.  This is meant
to simplify application programming and installation.
</OL>

<P>We recommend that you install the <TT>sfl.h</TT> file in
SYS$LIBRARY.  A typical application program starts like this:
<PRE>#include &lt;sfl.h&gt;
</PRE>

<HR>
<H3>Installation for Windows</H3>

<P>Briefly, either create a static library, and include that in
your project; create a .DLL and call that, or add the files you
want to use to your project and compile them as part of the
application.

<P>With MSVC 4.0, we find it useful to create a main project for the
application in hand, and a subproject for the SFL. We build the SFL as a
static library. If you use MFC, you must compile everything (including MFC)
in single-threaded mode, and use libd.

<P>Under MSVC 1.5x, there is a bug in the project manager that generates
invalid make files: the SFL prelude.h file refers to various non-Windows
include files, within #if statements. The MSVC 1.5x project manager includes
these in the make file; you must manually remove them. One solution is to
edit prelude.h; another is to use a Perl or Awk script to edit the make file
each time you change the project. You could also move to a different 16-bit
compiler. Finally, you can create the make files as empty files in the C
include directory.

<P>To build using the build.bat file with MSVC, you need to increase the
environment space to (e.g. to 16K), and define some variables in the
autoexec.bat file:
<PRE>SET CCNAME=msvc
SET CCDIR=C:\MSDEVSTD
SET INCDEF=C:\MSDEVSTD\INCLUDE
SET LIBDIR=C:\MSDEVSTD\sfl\lib
</PRE>
Where the LIBDIR variable is the directory where you unzipped the SFL stuff.


<HR>
<H3>Installation for MS-DOS</H3>

<P>To install the SFL on a MS-DOS system you need to:
<OL>
<LI>Download the source archive and decompress it.
<LI>Run build.bat to build the libsfl.lib library file.
<LI>Optionally, install the libsfl.lib file in central
directory.
<LI>Optionally, install the SFL header file(s) in a central
directory.
</OL>

<H4>Decompressing The Source Archive</H4>

<P>To unzip the $(*sflsrc.zip=source .zip file), you need the Infozip
$(*info-zip=unzip) tool, or PKzip version 2.04g or later, or a
compatible unzip program.:
<PRE>C:\DOWNLOAD> md temp
C:\DOWNLOAD> copy sflsrc$(version_no).zip temp
C:\DOWNLOAD> del sflsrc$(version_no).zip
C:\DOWNLOAD> cd temp
C:\DOWNLOAD> unzip sflsrc$(version_no)
</PRE>

<H4>Compiling The SFL Sources</H4>

<P>To compile under MS-DOS you need a Borland, Microsoft, or Watcom
compiler, or lcc-win32 or djgpp.  Look at the c.bat file, and set the
CCNAME and/or CCDIR environment variables as required.  Then, check that you
can compile a single program. e.g. 'c sflbits'.  When this works, run the
build.bat file to rebuild everything.

<P>The build scripts create a library file called libsfl.lib. You can
install this, and sfl.h, in a central directory if you wish.

<H4>Using The SFL In Your Applications</H4>

<P>To use an SFL function in your applications you must include a
header file that defines the structures, prototypes, and types for
the function API.  The SFL provides three types of header
files:
<OL>
<LI>One header file per function group.  These are provided for
reference; you will normally not use these directly.
<LI>A $(*uhf=Universal Header File) which encapsulates and

<LI>A $(*lhf=Library Header File) that contains the Universal
Header File and all the SFL header files in one go.  This is meant
to simplify application programming and installation.
</OL>

<P>We recommend that you install the <TT>sfl.h</TT> file in the
/include directory of your compiler.  A typical application
program starts like this:
<PRE>#include &lt;sfl.h&gt;
</PRE>

<H3>The Universal Header File - prelude.h</H3>

<H4>What and Why?</H4>

<P>The Universal Header File a technology that we have developed
to make C applications more easily portable with less effort.  One
of the big difficulties in compiling C code on different platforms
is that header files change their names, locations, and internal
functions from system to system, even on one system over time.

<P>Typically, you may see C programs that start with a rash of
<TT>#ifdef</TT>'s mixed with <TT>#include</TT>'s depending on the
system, compiler, and specific needs of the program.

<P>Since we are basically really lazy, all this unnecessary work
is intolerable.  We would <EM>much</EM> rather make the compiler
work harder.  The systems we develop on (typically MS-DOS with
Turbo-C) are so fast that we can afford to take a really lazy
approach.

<P>So, what we do is this: we include every 'useful' and
'standard' header file that we can think of.  We then include
every 'useful' non-portable file that we've ever needed, in a
clean way, so that application code does not need to 'know' how it
was done.

<P>At the same time we define lots of things that make life
easier.  Generally we don't like macros, since these create
'pseudo languages' that are just more work to learn.  However,
some things (like <TT>#define FOREVER for (;;)</TT>) are so useful
and pretty comonplace, so we stick them in too.

<P>Lastly, we flatten-out the problem called 'what system am I
running on', by providing a set of definitions like
<TT>__UNIX__</TT> and <TT>__UTYPE_SUNOS</TT> that code can use if
it has to.  Again, it can be quite messy to figure-out that we're
compiling on a Brand X, so we need this-and-that header file.  We
hide this so that we can forget about it.

<P>Okay, those are the benefits of this approach.  What are the
costs?  We typically hear these criticisms:
<UL>
<LI>Compilation is a <EM>lot</EM> slower.  True, but when you
create portable applications, you can do 90% of your compiles on a
system that is so fast that this is irrelevant
<LI>Some C programmers may feel they are losing control over which
header files are included, in which order, etc.  True, but it's
the kind of control we don't want.
<LI>We get some comments about 'polluting the namespace'.  We
don't really understand this one.  We try to stay away from
already-defined symbols.
<LI>People don't like the macros we define, like TRUE and FALSE.
This can become a matter of personal choice; we've tried to
provide useful stuff without becoming baroque.
</UL>

<P>We use the Universal Header File in <EM>all</EM> C projects
(not just those based on the SFL).  If it was not for the simple
fact that it has helped us a lot, we'd probably not make it
available.

<H4>Using the Universal Header File</H4>

<P>You should probably read through the <TT>prelude.h</TT> file to
best understand it.  Our usual habit is to comment the code first,
so that it's self-explanatory.  The SFL documentation has a
section on the Universal Header File.  This section is generated
from the code.

<P>When you use the SFL Library Header File (<TT>sfl.h</TT>), you
don't need to include <TT>prelude.h</TT>, since it's already
embedded in <TT>sfl.h</TT>.  This makes application programming
easier (just one header file to include).  If you need to change
<TT>prelude.h</TT>, you can either change <TT>sfl.h</TT> as well,
or rebuild <TT>sfl.h</TT> using the build script.  Better still,
tell us what you want to change, so that we can maintain a single
version of the file.

.build anchor lhf
<H3>The Library Header File - sfl.h</H3>

<P>Each module in the SFL consists of a header file and one or
more C source files.  You can choose to include the header files
that you want (this is what the SFL source code does), but this
can quickly become burdensome.  To simplify matters, a single
header file <TT>sfl.h</TT> contains all the individual header
files.  It also contains the Universal Header File.

<H3>System Notes</H3>

<H4>MS-DOS</H4>

<P>Most of the SFL is portable to MS-DOS.  Exceptions are: the
socket i/o functions (sflsock), the user/group ID functions
(sfluid) and the server process functions (sflserv).  These are
all null; you can call any of the functions, but they will return
either an okay feedback (in most cases) or an error feedback (for
the socket functions).  The SFL compiles cleanly with Borland
Turbo C/C++ 1.0 and Microsoft VC++ 4.x and 5.x, and should work
with Borland C/C++ and C++ Builder.

<H4>MS-Windows</H4>

<P>Most of the SFL is portable to Windows 3.x, Windows 95, and
Windows NT.  Exceptions are: the user/group ID functions (sfluid)
and the server process functions (sflserv).  These are all null;
you can call any of the functions, but they will return an okay
feedback.  The SFL compiles cleanly with Microsoft VC++ 4.x and
5.x, and should work with Borland C/C++ and C++ Builder.

<H4>Digital VAX</H4>

<P>The SFL is portable to Digital VMS except for the directory
access functions (sfldir), user/group functions (sfluid) and the
server process functions (sflserv).  The sfldir functions will be
implemented at a later date.  The other functions are null; you
can call any of the functions, but they will return an okay
feedback.  The SFL compiles cleanly with Vax C and Dec C and has
been tested with various releases of these compilers.

<H4>Linux</H4>

<P>The SFL is fully portable to Linux and has been tested with GNU
C.  It should give no compiler warning errors.

<H4>Sun OS and Sun Sparc</H4>

<P>The SFL is fully portable to Sun OS.  You may have trouble
finding an ANSI C compiler, especially on Sparc systems.  People
sometimes install GNU C, using the Sun header files and libraries.
This should work, although we have not tested it recently.
Sometimes the Sun ANSI C compiler is called acc, not cc.  You can
use the CCNAME environment variable to point to the right compiler
name.  Some Sun C compilers give warnings when you use the ANSI
compile mode.  You can ignore these warnings.

<P>See also the warning about 'Other UNIX Systems'; some SunOS
installations show this symptom.

<H4>HP/UX</H4>

<P>The SFL is fully portable to HP/UX.  It should give no compiler
warning errors.

<H4>IBM AIX</H4>

<P>The SFL is fully portable to IBM/AIX.  It should give no
compiler warning errors.

<H4>Digital UNIX</H4>

<P>The SFL is fully portable to Digital UNIX.  It should give no
compiler warning errors.  When compiling on an Alpha system, the
word size is 64 bits.

<H4>Other UNIX Systems</H4>

<P>The directory functions can fail on SVr4 if the &lt;dirent.h&gt;
file does not match the C library.  Recompile with CCDEFINES set to
the value "-D _USE_BSD_DIRENT" and they should work a bit better.
Under Solaris with GCC, you should <EM>not</EM> define this macro.

<H4>OS/2</H4>

<P>The SFL was ported to OS/2 by Ewen McNiell around New Year's
Eve 1996.  It runs under EMX.  The SFL distribution kit includes
an OS/2 build script.  The 'c' script runs under OS/2 as well as
UNIX.

<H3>To Do List</H3>

<UL>
<LI>There are many areas that we've just started to look at, or
have ignored completely.  For instance, the encryption functions
are useful but basic.
<LI>We have not conducted exhaustive tests on all platforms, so
while older routines are certainly very well tested and portable,
some of the newer ones are still doubtful.  What we would really
like (sigh) is an automated test suite that checks-out every
function.
<LI>The bitstring functions in SFLBITS are part of an ongoing
project.  We are building an indexing tool that provides the kind
of fast lookup you find in modern search engines.  The basic idea
is really quite simple.  You number each text block (page, file,
paragraph).  Then you read the text and take each word.  The word
corresponds to a bitstring, with one bit corresponding to each
text block.  So, if you have a million text blocks, the bitstring
is a million bits long.  You set the corresponding bit for that
text block to 1, and save the bitmap.  You repeat this for all
words in all blocks of text.  That's the indexing part.  Now, to
do a lookup, you take the bitstrings that correspond to the words
entered.  Each bitstring is effectively a list of text blocks.
You can AND and OR the bitstrings to come-up with a final result.
Find all the 1's, read the text blocks, and that's it.  Of course
the real work is to make the results useful: you have to filter
junk, false matches, etc.  The bitstring functions currently just
do one thing: they let you store and change really long bitmaps
in a compressed form.
