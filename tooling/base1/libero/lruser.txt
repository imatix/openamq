<H2>Running The lr Program</H2>

<P>To run Libero, type the 'lr' command like this:</P>

<PRE>
    $ lr [options] dialogname...
</PRE>

<P>Libero is a code generator.  It works as follows: you write a dialog
description, and Libero generates (by default) C code to execute the dialog.
This C code contains (a) various tables and definitions, and (b) the FSM
engine.  If necessary, Libero also generates (c) a skeleton C program to wrap
the whole thing together.  When you change your dialog (many times during
program development), Libero re-generates (a) and (b) and any new bits
needed in (c).</P>

<P>When you run the lr command, Libero goes through these steps:
<UL>
<LI>It displays a start-up message and checks that it can find its message
file.  If this fails, there is a problem with the PATH definition.</LI>
<LI>It reads the dialog file(s) you specified.</LI>
<LI>For each dialog file, it run the language-specific schema file.  The
schema generates code, the exact mechanics depending on the language in
question:<BR>
1. If necessary, the schema creates a skeleton program.<BR>
2. If necessary, the schema adds empty module 'stubs' to the end of the
program for each module in the dialog.  You will often want to rearrange
these in a meaningful order.<BR>
3. The schema generates the tables and code required to run your dialog
program.  These go into include files or other code modules.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>The standard C schema is LRSCHEMA.C.  This schema creates two include
files, with the dialog's name, but extensions '.D' and '.I'.  The first of
these contains the DATA, the second the INTERPRETER.  Other schemas (for
other programming languages) have different conventions.</P>

<P>Dialogs have the extension .l, though you can be bloody-minded and use
other extensions.  On systems that support long filenames, the name can be up
to 128 characters long, including the extension.  I seriously recommend that
you stick to eight-character filenames for anything that is remotely useful.
When I were a lad, filenames were one hex digit.  To create a new dialog,
take skeleton.l and copy it.  I recommend that you give a dialog the same
name as the program it drives.  For instance, a source file myprog.c would
use a dialog  myprog.l.  Sometimes I append a 'd' to the name to make the
filename (without extension) unique.  Then, for instance, the .bak files that
my editor creates carry different names.</P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page The Dialog File Syntax

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>This is the skeleton.l file - it is a useful starting point for new
dialogs:</P>

<PRE>
!
!   myprogd.l   Dialog description for myprog.c
!
!   Written:    yy/mm/dd  My name
!   Revised:    yy/mm/dd
!
!   Syntax:  '!' comment header
!            -option[=value]
!            [ state-name ':' [ '&lt;'Superstate-Name'&gt;' ]...
!                  [ '(' event-nbr ')' event-name [ '-&gt;' next-
state ]
!                  [ '+' module-name ]... ]... ]...
!
-source=myprog

After-Init:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt;
          +
    (--) Error                      -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program

Defaults:
    (--) Exception                  -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>The dialog file defines a series of <EM>states</EM>: the first state in
the dialog is the starting state, and the remaining states can come in any
order.  You cannot define the same state twice.  A state carries a name,
which is purely for your (the reader's) information.  A state allows one or
more <EM>events</EM>.  The ordering of events within a state is not
important.  Each event looks like this:
<PRE>
    (--) Event-Name                 -&gt; Next-State-Name
          + Module-To-Execute
          + Module-To-Execute
          ...
</PRE>
The module list is executed when that event occurs in the state.  The module
list can be empty.  The next state name can be
blank, meaning 'the current state'.  Otherwise the next state name refers to
another state within the dialog, excluding the initial starting state.</P>

<P>The module names correspond to functions, blocks, procedures, etc. in the
program.  Since various languages and individuals like different conventions
for naming modules, Libero always uses Names-Like-This, which may refer to
pieces of code labelled 'NamesLikeThis', 'names_like_this', 'NAMES-LIKE-
THIS', etc.</P>

<P>The program always refers to events by adding the suffix '-Event'.  Thus,
if a dialog refers to an event 'Ok', the program will refer to 'Ok-Event',
allowing for whatever name-mashing the language imposes.</P>

<P>A program never refers to state/next-state names.  These are there only to
make the dialog more readable, and useful.  You could, if you wanted to,
refer to states as 'S1', 'S2', 'S3', instead of 'Expecting-Token', 'Have-
Number', 'Have-String'.   Hahaha.  I've seen people doing this.</P>

<P>An event name '$other' is taken to mean 'all other events'.   This
is shorthand for typing all other events in the dialog: any event you
did not already handle in the state gets the '$other' handling.</P>

<P>Note that:
<UL>
<LI>You can put a comment anywhere, starting with '!' until the end of the
line.  I advise you to put comments on lines of their own; the pretty
printing function in Libero will then work better.</LI>
<LI>You can put options before the first state, several per line or one per
line.  If you put several on one line, separate them by spaces as you do on
the command line.</LI>
<LI>You need one or more spaces between words.  Libero is not fussy about the
amount of blank space or line breaks between words.  However, I recommend the
layout above as it is easy to read, and if you use Libero for Windows, it
will rewrite the dialog in this format in any case.</LI>
<LI>Use an editor that lets you cut and paste lines easily, and that works in
overwrite mode.  This is the easiest way to write dialogs.</LI>
<LI>If you intend to move dialog files between systems (MS-DOS, UNIX,
VMS,...) don't use tabs.  These don't align the same on different
systems.</LI>
<LI>It is quite okay to make a sloppy dialog; the -pretty option in Libero
will straighten things out.  However, a good programmer should need this.
</LI>
</UL></P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Libero Options

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Like most command-line programs, lr accepts various options. These control
things such as the language that Libero generates, the filenames it uses,
etc.</P>

<P>You can supply an option in various ways:
<UL>
<LI>Type the option when you run lr.  This is good for options that you use
now and then.</LI>

<LI>Place the option in the dialog file itself (at the start of the file,
anywhere before the first state).  This is good for options that are specific
to that dialog file.</LI>

<LI>Place the option in a global initialisation file, usually called lr.ini,
somewhere on the path.  This is good for options that you want for all your
work.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>It sometimes gets a little complex to remember which option is active,
especially if you put the same option in various places. For instance you
could put '-nocheck' in lr.ini, then run the <TT>lr</TT> command with the '
check' option.  Which takes precedence?  The answer is: it works like it
should.  This is a somewhat arrogant statement, so I'll explain:
<UL>
<LI>Each option has a default value, as explained below.  When Libero starts
up, this is the value.</LI>

<LI>Libero reads the <TT>lr.ini</TT> file and uses the options in that file.
These can change the default values.</LI>

<LI>Libero then looks at any options in the dialog file.</LI>

<LI>Libero looks at the lr command line and processes any options you typed
there.  Libero picks-up a -help option right away, as well as a -initial or
-path, since these affect which lr.ini file it reads.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>If you are unsure of the options in effect for your dialog, run
<TT>lr</TT> with the -settings option.  This displays the current options.
You can specify a Libero option in various forms:<BR>

<DL>
<DT>-option</DT>
<DD>Normal usage.</DD>
<DT>-option=value</DT>
<DD>Option takes value.</DD>
<DT>-option:value</DT>
<DD>Also okay.</DD>
<DT>-option="value"</DT>
<DD>Don't convert value to lowercase.</DD>
<DT>-option:'value'</DT>
<DD>The same as above.</DD>
<DT>-nooption</DT>
<DD>switch off true/false option.</DD>
<DT>-option=no</DT>
<DT>-option=false</DT>
<DD>The same as above.</DD>
</DL>

<P>You can abbreviate an option name to 3 or more characters.
Option values are converted to lower-case unless you place them
in single or double quotes. Some options take values; others are
true/false options.  These is a summary of the options that lr
accepts:</P>

<PRE>
Option            Explanation                        Default

-animate          include animation code             -noanimate

-style=normal     naming style: Some-Module-Name
-style=cobol      naming style: SOME-MODULE-NAME
-trace            trace code generation to list file
</PRE>

<P>And now in detail:
<UL>
<LI><B>-[no]animate</B> - include or exclude animation code.  If
you use this option, the schema will generate code that displays
each new state, event, and action as the dialog runs.  This is
useful for debugging.  The default is -noanimate.</LI>

<LI><B>-author</B> - Libero uses this value when it creates a
new file for you.  Put the string in quotes to include spaces:
-author='My Name'.  On the MS-DOS command line, you must type
this (two sets of quotes): "-author='My name'".  The default is
"Your Name".</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]check</B> - generate full runtime checks.  If you
use this option, the schema will generate code that checks for
invalid or missing events while the program runs.  Keep this
option unless you are sure it is slowing down a crucial dialog.
The default is -check.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]compress</B> - compress the generated tables.
Currently, this means:removing unused states.  You can disable
this using the nocompress option.  The default is
-compress.</LI>

<LI><B>-defaults=state</B> - the name of the Defaults state.
This state serves to collect events that can happen in any other
state; you can make the dialog smaller and simpler by placing
these into the Defaults state.  The default is "Defaults".</LI>

<LI><B>-dpath=variable</B> - Libero uses this path to search for
the lr.ini file and the dialog file.  You can use the name of an
environment variable (a logical variable under VMS) or a literal
path.  If the case is important, enclose it in quotes.  For
example, under MS-DOS: -dpath='LRPATH'.  Libero always searches
the current directory first.  The default is empty, in which
case Libero uses the -path value.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]generate</B> - generate output code.  If you want to
check the dialog but not generate any output, use -nogen.  The
default is -generate.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]idle</B> - indicate idle modules.  Libero lists any
modules in your program that are not referenced in the dialog.
This can happen when you change a dialog.  The default is
-noidle.</LI>

<LI><B>-initial=file</B> - tells Libero to read options from
some specific file instead of lr.ini.  You can use this option
on the command line only. The default is "lr.ini".</LI>

<LI><B>-option:name=value</B> - supply a specific option value
to a schema. This allows the schema to generate code
conditionally, or fill-in specific values.  The 'name' is a
variable defined in the schema; the 'value' overrides any
default that the schema specifies.  The 'value' can be a full
expression, including references to other schema variables.</LI>

<LI><B>-path=name</B> - Libero uses this path to search for its
message file and the schema used to generate code.  You can use
the name of an environment variable (a logical variable under
VMS) or a literal path.  If the case is important, enclose it in
quotes.  For example, under MS-DOS: -path='LRPATH'.  Libero
always searches the current directory first.  The default is
"PATH" (in uppercase).  See also -dpath.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]plusd</B> - enforce the "source+D" naming rule.  The
default is -noplusd.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]pretty</B> - rewrite the dialog, aligning it using
the standard Libero conventions.  This can work nicely.  Your
original dialog is saved with the extension .bak.  Does not
generate any code.  The default is -nopretty.</LI>

<LI><B>-schema=file</B> - schema for code generation.  If you
override this default, be sure to specify the file extension.
The default is "lrschema.c".</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]settings</B> - show option settings for each file
processed.  The default is -nosettings.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]sort</B> - output new module stubs in sorted order.
Depending on your preferences, you may want to keep modules in
sorted order or natural order.  The default is -nosort.</LI>

<LI><B>-source=file</B> - program that uses the dialog.  By
default the name of the dialog, unless you use -plusd option, in
which case it is the name of the dialog minus an obligatory
'D'.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]stats</B> - report the number of states, events, and
modules in the dialog.  The default is -nostats.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]stubs</B> - generate stubs for modules which are
referenced in the dialog but do not (yet) exist in the program.
The default value for this option is -stubs.  If you use
-nostubs, you will have to make new module stubs by hand.  So
leave -stubs on.</LI>

<LI><B>-style={plain|caps|heading|title|normal|cobol}</B> -
style for module and event names.  The default is 'plain'.  You
can use this to adapt Libero's output to your preferred
programming style; do not change halfway through a project
unless you like doing major cleanups.</LI>

<LI><B>-[no]trace</B> - create a report file that traces the
code generator's output.  This is useful if you are writing or
changing a schema, and cannot get it to work.  The trace file is
called <EM>dialog</EM>.lst.  The default is -notrace.</LI>
</UL></P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using Exceptions

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

Exceptions are basically a tool to reduce the size of a dialog.
Instead of defining an extra state to handle a decision (typically
the Ok/Error outcome of some work), you assume it's Ok, and carry on
with the next action module directly.  If it's Error, you raise an
exception, which is like a jump to that event in the same state.  Any
module in progress is completed, but any further modules are not
executed by the dialog manager.

It's often useful to put exception events into the Defaults state,
since certain kinds errors can occur in any state.  So you can raise
an exception in any code, and know that it will be handled the same
way, in the Defaults state.  Sometimes we override such central
handling by defining specific handling for an exception event in a
specific state.

Exceptions are thus used to make small control steps within a state
(error handling is just one specific example).  Such control steps
can be used for any purpose.

Overusing exceptions leads to impenetrable dialogs.

<P>Exceptions are a powerful technique that make your dialog leaner and
meaner.  In a typical dialog many actions do some work that may result in an
error condition.  For instance, an action that reads some data from a file
may discover that the file is no longer accessible due to a 'hard' error
(protection, disk crash, insufficient memory,...).  Without exceptions, the
only way to handle such possibilities is to define additional states - for
instance, 'after-reading-data', that check the outcome of each action with a
questionable outcome.</P>

<P>This quickly leads to dialogs with dozens of states that serve only to
keep track of these minority cases.  In the majority of cases, the errors
never happen.  This means that the main logic of the dialog can get diluted
by all the extraneous states.  With exceptions, you write the dialog as
though errors were incidental. When an error happens, you treat it as a
special case, as an 'exception'.  Otherwise, the dialog carries on
normally.</P>

<P>Most real dialogs use exceptions, sometimes heavily, for two reasons:
<OL>
<LI>Exceptions are a good way to handle errors.</LI>
<LI>Exceptions can make a complex dialog simpler.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P>A module raises an exception by setting the variable Exception-Raised to a
'true' value.  The module then supplies an event in The-Exception-Event.
Quite often I use an event called 'Exception' when I use an exception event
to handle fatal errors. This is how we raise an exception using an event
called Exception-Event in various languages:</P>

<P>C and C++:</P>
<PRE>
    exception_raised = TRUE;
    the_exception_event = exception_event;
</PRE>

<P>80x86 assembler:</P>
<PRE>
    mov exception_raised,1
    mov the_exception_event,exception_event
</PRE>

<P>Korn Shell:</P>
<PRE>
    exception_raised=TRUE
    the_exception_event=$exception_event
</PRE>

<P>COBOL:</P>
<PRE>
    MOVE "YES" TO EXCEPTION-RAISED
    MOVE EXCEPTION-EVENT TO THE-EXCEPTION-EVENT
</PRE>

<P>Visual Basic:</P>
<PRE>
    exception_raised = True
    the_exception_event = exception_event
</PRE>

<P>In most languages (except COBOL) Libero provides a function or macro
'Raise-Exception' that does the above.  See the later sections on using
Libero in each language for details.</P>

<P>The dialog normally executes all the action modules for an event-in-state,
one by one, then switches to the next state for the event.  An exception
interrupts this flow. The dialog handles exceptions in two steps:
<OL>
<LI>It checks Exception-Raised after executing each module.  It this variable
has become 'true', it stops and checks the value of The-Exception-Event.</LI>
<LI>It looks for The-Exception-Event in the current state (or Defaults), then
executes the action modules for that event.  These modules can in turn raise
an exception.</LI>
</OL></P>

<P>When a module raises an exception, the dialog does not care what the next
state was supposed to be.  This is no longer important, since the exception
event will determine its own next state.</P>

<P>Libero also allows a short-cut: if the exception event is the same as the
current event, you don't need to supply it.  If you just set Exception-Raised
but not the event, the dialog loops back to the same event in the same state.
Honestly, I don't use this very often.  I prefer to separate exception events
from 'normal' events.</P>

<P>Take the example of three actions which the dialog executes in series.
First, it reads some data from a file.  Then it parses and converts the data.
Lastly, it writes the data to another file.  Each of these actions has a
normal outcome, and possible exceptional outcomes (error during reading,
invalid data, error during writing, etc.).  If we write the dialog without
exceptions, we need these three states:</P>

<PRE>
Before-Reading:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; After-Reading
          + Read-Data-From-Input
    (--) Error                      -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program

After-Reading:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; After-Parsing
          + Parse-and-Convert-Data
    (--) Error                      -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program

After-Parsing:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Another-State
          + Write-Data-To-Output
          + ...
    (--) Error                      -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>In this case, Read-Data-From-Input does something like this (I use C as
the language):</P>

<PRE>
MODULE read_data_from_input (void)
{
    if (read_from_file (file, input) != NULL)
        the_next_event = ok_event;
    else
        the_next_event = error_event;
}
</PRE>

<P>By using an exception event (here, Error), we can collapse the three
states into a single state:</P>

<PRE>
Before-Reading:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Another-State
          + Read-Data-From-Input
          + Parse-and-Convert-Data
          + Write-Data-To-Output
          + ...
    (--) Error                      -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>Read-Data-From-Input now does this:</P>

<PRE>
MODULE read_data_from_input (void)
{
    if (read_from_file (file, input) == NULL)
        raise_exception (error_event);
}
</PRE>

<P>Some hints about using exception events:
<OL>
<LI>Don't over-use exceptions.  What you gain from a more compact dialog you
can loose in unclear logic.  Remember that exceptions should be used for
error handling and special cases, not for primary logic.</LI>
<LI>Choose good names, and use one exception event for the same purpose
everywhere.  For instance, use an exception event Fatal-Error to indicate a
fatal i/o error that causes the dialog to halt.</LI>
<LI>The Defaults state is an ideal place to handle exceptions which may occur
in many places.  However, do place specific exception handling in any state
where it is useful.</LI>

.page Using The Defaults State

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>You can define a single Defaults state in any dialog.  You use this state
to simplify dialogs.  Often, the same event can happen in many states, with
the same effect.  Typically, you want to handle a fatal error at any point by
displaying a message and halting the program.</P>

<P>Rather than repeating the event and its (identical) actions in every state
where the fatal error may happen, place it in Defaults.  If the event ever
happens, Libero looks in the current state first.  If it cannot find the
event there it looks in the Defaults state.  The Defaults state is ideal for
error exception events that require central handling.</P>

<P>After processing the actions for the event, the dialog sets the next state
as follows: if the specified next state is empty, it returns to the original
state.  If some next state is specified, it goes to that state.</P>

<P>When you use a Defaults state, the generated code for your dialog does not
get smaller.  It will actually get a little larger.  But your dialog source
code can usually be simplified, and this is always a good idea.</P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using Sub-Dialogs

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Libero supports a simple state call/return mechanism.  This lets you build
sub-dialogs that are called from other places in the dialog.  In the
'calling' state, use the action Dialog-Call to call the sub-dialog state:</P>

<PRE>
Calling-State:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Sub-State
          + Do-Some-Normal-Work
          + Dialog-Call
    (--) Return                     -&gt; Next-State
          + Continue-After-Call
</PRE>

<P>The Return event controls what happens when the sub-state returns.  The
Return event can be in the same state, or in the Defaults state.</P>

<P>The sub-dialog can consist of one or many states.  You should probably use
some kind of naming convention to indicate that these states go together.  At
some point, the sub-dialog uses the action Dialog-Return.  This ends the
sub-dialog and continues in the calling state with the Return event.</P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using Super-States

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Some dialogs have a lot of states that are similar except for small
differences, like Expecting-Initial and Expecting-Operand above.  We can
write these in a more compact way using a shorthand technique called
super-states.  We put the super-state name between '&lt;' and '&gt;' after
the state name:</P>

<PRE>
Expecting-Initial: &lt;Expecting-Operand&gt;
    (--) End-Mark                   -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>The state inherits the events in the super-state, if they are not already
defined.  In the above example we say that Expecting-Initial inherits events
from Expecting-Operand, and also handles the End-Mark event.</P>

<P>A super-state can itself be based on super-states, to any level.  My
advice is: use super-states with care to simplify large dialogs.  Don't
exaggerate.  Some more points about super-states:
<UL>
<LI>You can think of super-states as 'local defaults' states.</LI>

<LI>If a super-state is not used anywhere in the dialog, it is not included
in the generated code.</LI>

<LI>When a state inherits an event, it may change the 'next state' name.  If
this is blank, or refers to the super-state (which is semantically the same),
it is changed to be the name of the inheriting state.</LI>
</UL></P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using Templates

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>The standard Libero schemas support templates.  This just means that you
can build a library of code that the generator will pull-in whenever you use
it in a dialog.</P>

<P>For example, let's say that you are working in a COBOL application where a
lot of programs need to do the same work in Initialise-The-Program:</P>

<PRE>
    MOVE LINKAGE-BLOCK TO OWN-LINKAGE-BLOCK
    PERFORM CHECK-LINKAGE-VALUES
    IF CURRENT-LANGUAGE = SPACES
        MOVE "ENGLISH" TO CURRENT-LANGUAGE
</PRE>

<P>You can either:
<UL>
<LI>Retype or copy this code into each new program you create. This is extra
effort for nothing.</LI>
<LI>Modify the standard schema.  This is also extra effort, not today, but
when the next release of Libero comes around.</LI>
<LI>Use a COPY book (an included file) for the common code.  This is okay if
the code is regularly changed, or large.  For many small pieces of code you
just get a terrible burden of managing lots of these COPY books.
<LI>Use a template.  Of course, this is the way to do it.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Let's say you make a file called TEMPLATE.cob.  This looks like this:</P>

<PRE>
&lt;Initialise-The-Program&gt;
    MOVE LINKAGE-BLOCK TO OWN-LINKAGE-BLOCK
    PERFORM CHECK-LINKAGE-VALUES
    IF CURRENT-LANGUAGE = SPACES
        MOVE "ENGLISH" TO CURRENT-LANGUAGE
&lt;END&gt;
</PRE>

<P>Now, when you build a new program, Libero magically includes
this code in the INITIALISE-THE-PROGRAM section.  This is how templates
work:
<UL>
<LI>Each schema looks for a template file with the same extension as the
schema.  If the template file does not exist, this is okay.</LI>

<LI>The schema 'pulls in' code at various points.  Again, if it cannot find
the code it's looking for, that is okay.</LI>

<LI>Each section in the template starts with a keyword between "&lt;" and
"&gt;" and ends in "&lt;END&gt;".  The schemas define a number of standard
section keywords: "&lt;HEADER&gt;" and "&lt;DATA&gt;", plus one section per
module.</LI>

<LI>The keywords are case-sensitive.  &gt;Get-next-token&gt; is not the same
as &gt;Get-Next-Token&gt;.  The second form is correct; the first will not
work.</LI>

<LI>The template can be in the current directory, or on the path.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>The file template provides an example that you can use for your own
templates.</P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Using Get-External-Event

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>The Get-External-Event module is empty in most types of program, and very
important in other ones.  This module lets you centralise any kind of
interface to the outside world that collects events.  An example of this is
the $(*rover=Rover) subprogram we designed above.  The dialog explicitly
does a Wait-for-incoming-message before each new state. We can put this code
into Get-external-event, which makes the dialog simpler.</P>

<P>Here I also move all handling for Onhook to the Defaults state - assuming
that the Stop-Local-Tones module is safe to use at any time:</P>

<PRE>
After-Init:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Idle

.page Efficiency

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Efficiency of The Generated Code</H3>

<P>People sometimes ask of Libero: "But does it produce efficient programs?".
Bad grammar apart, this question gets a considered answer.  Usually I say:
"What do you mean by 'efficient'?", or "Does a hammer build a solid table?".
I have a practical definition of 'efficient': if a program is easy to write,
easy to maintain, does the job on time, and no-one has trouble with it, it's
efficient.  It's also unusual, but that is another soap-box.</P>

<P>When I wrote Libero, my true goal was to make programming easier and
safer, whatever the language.  This also gives me a convenient stock answer:
if you write a program using Libero, and you find that it runs too slowly,
you can rewrite it in a faster language quickly and cheaply.</P>

<H3>Efficiency of The Dialog</H3>

<P>First of all, the size of a dialog has only a slight relationship to the
speed of the program.  A very large program will load and maybe run slower
than a small one, but the program has to be a lot larger.</P>

<P>Secondly, adding a new state, event, or action module will make the
generated code larger.  If a dialog has 10 states, then a new event will add
20 words to the program size.  If a dialog has 50 states, then a new event
will add 100 words.  A dialog with 100 states and 100 events will use a
whopping 20,000 words of storage for its main tables.  It is possible to
compress large FSM tables, but I never had a problem that was so complex that
it was worth it.  It is a function that one could add to Libero in the
future. However, a program this complex is likely to be several tens of
thousands of lines long.</P>

<P>So, I generally tell people: if you make your dialog smaller, do it
because it is better design, not because it is more efficient.</P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Care and Feeding of Dialogs

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Style - Good, Bad, and Ugly</H3>

<P>Some of the worst dialogs that I have seen were written by people who were
trying to make their dialogs 'efficient'.  It is not easy to write elegant
and readable dialogs; it is a little like making pancakes: give the first one
to the dog.  I have some advice: ask a colleague to read the dialog and
explain how the program works.  If your colleague cannot understand
something, rewrite it.</P>

<P>The following extracts are from real-life dialogs that went wrong.  I
changed names and did some surgery to protect the guilty, and myself from
prosecution.  All I can say in defence of the authors was that these were
early works, and that they had too little training.</P>

<P>Example 1: the author tries to reduce the number of states by looping back
to the same state several times.  Then he (I know the lad, so I can safely
use the pronoun) compounds the sin by using event names that are specific to
the state:</P>

<PRE>
Valorisation:
    (--) Valori-Not-Ok              -&gt; Valorisation
          + Update-Valorisation
          + Get-Next-Valorisation
    (--) Valori-Ok                  -&gt; Valorisation
          + Process-Valorisation
          + Get-Next-Valorisation
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Valorisation
          + Test-Valorisation
    (--) No-Valori                  -&gt; Valorisation
          + Get-Next-Valorisation
    (--) No-More                    -&gt; Transfer
          + Get-First-Transfer

Transfer:
    (--) Transf-Not-Ok              -&gt; Transfer
          + Update-Transfer
          + Get-Next-Transfer
    (--) Transf-Ok                  -&gt; Transfer
          + Process-Transfer
          + Get-Next-Transfer
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Transfer
          + Test-Transfer
    (--) No-Transf                  -&gt; Transfer
          + Get-Next-Transfer
    (--) No-More                    -&gt;
          + Close-Data-Files
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>This is the advice I gave:
<UL>
<LI>Don't use a single state when the design demands several states.  This
does not save space - since you have to invent more event names - it just
makes the dialog hard to understand.</LI>

<LI>Use exceptions to reduce the complexity of a dialog.</LI>

<LI>Don't use event names that are only meaningful in one state, like
'Transf-Not-Ok'.  This makes the code less reusable.  It also tightens the
binding between action modules and the state, which is makes it harder to
reuse action modules and change the dialog.</LI>

<LI>Use meaningful names for states.  The state is an important concept in
the design.</LI>

<LI>Use helpful names for the action modules.  Test-Transfer tells the reader
very little about what is happening.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Example 2: the author is struggling with a complex batch process.  At this
stage he has to do a whole series of actions, with one small difference
depending on the contents of a key field:</P>

<PRE>
After-Test-Key:
    (--) Key-Empty                  -&gt; Have-Order
          + Save-Current-Order-Record
          + Get-Contract-For-Order
          + Get-Company-For-Contract
          + Create-Invoice-Header
          + Update-Company
          + Save-Contract-Key
          + Call-Batch-012
          + Call-Batch-013
          + Get-Next-Order-Record
    (--) Key-Not-Empty              -&gt; Have-Order
          + Treat-For-Current
          + Save-Current-Order-Record
          + Get-Contract-For-Order
          + Get-Company-For-Contract
          + Create-Invoice-Header
          + Update-Company
          + Save-Contract-Key
          + Call-Batch-012
          + Call-Batch-013
          + Get-Next-Order-Record
</PRE>

<P>This was my advice (resisting the urge to say 'junk it!'):
<UL>
<LI>Don't be obsessed by detailed breakdowns of logic.  Perhaps the whole
series of steps above could be better bundled into two modules:
Process-Order-Record and Get-Next-Order-Record.</LI>

<LI>Don't copy large chunks of code like this; it creates a maintenance
problem.</LI>

<LI>The only difference between the two action lists is the extra action
Treat-for-Current (whatever that means).  It is quite okay to internalise
this step and have a module like Treat-for-Current-If-Key-Filled.  Don't
bring microdecisions up to the level of the dialog.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Example 3: the author has used some other design method to start with, and
then translated the result into a dialog.  The events have names like
'Case-1', 'Case-2', or 'Ok' and 'Not-Ok'.  I've seen this happen often, and
it never works.  If the project leader is not prepared to use a dialog as a
primary design method, there is no benefit in trying to translate another
design into a dialog.  You must in such cases rewrite the dialog cleanly.  A
dialog is primarily for a readership, and secondarily for the computer.
Ignore this at your peril: you will produce large, incomprehensible dialogs
that are error-prone and fragile.</P>

<P>This is an approach that is so common, and so wrong, that the warning
bears repeating: <EM>Do not try to mechanically convert existing designs into
dialogs.  It will not work.  You will make a fool of yourself.</EM></P>

<P>Often, this also applies to designs already expressed as state machines.
In one of the worst cases I ever saw, the culprit had mechanically converted
a set of state-machine based designs into dialogs.  The states were called
S1, S2, S3,... The events were called E1, E2, E3,...  The modules were called
M1, M2, M3,... This happened in 1986.  In January 1996 I watched someone
painfully maintain one of these programs, trying to understand what E4 in S3
actually meant.  Okay, I warned you.  Now back to the main story.</P>

<P>These are some more common problems:
<UL>
<LI>Dialog modules that explicitly set an event, like 'Set-Ok'.   We call
this a <EM>control shunt</EM>.  It usually indicates that the author has
confused the notion of <EM>state</EM> with the notion of <EM>action</EM>.  By
shunting to some specific state, the author says 'I want to be in this state
to do some specific work'.  Very rarely, this is a good way to write a
dialog.  99% of times, though, it is bad practice.  If you find yourself
doing a control shunt, change the dialog so you do the work in question
<EM>as early as possible</EM> in the dialog, thus generating an event which
you can handle neatly in the next state.</LI>
<LI>Dialogs that are broken into very many small states.  This usually means
that the designer has not figured-out how exceptions work.</LI>
<LI>Dialogs that use lots and lots of different event names.</LI>
</UL></P>

<H3>Choosing Names</H3>

<P>These are some guide-lines for names in a dialog:
<UL>
<LI>States: In-Some-State, After-Something, Before-Something,
Expecting-Something, Have-Some-Data.</LI>
<LI>Events: external actions: Help, Exit, Delete, Create,...
Internal conditions: Ok, Error, Locked, Fatal-Error, No-More;
Types: Number, String, Function,...</LI>
<LI>Modules: active statements: Delete-The-Record, Print-Current-
Invoice, Start-The-Transaction, Commit-All-Changes,...</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>A common beginner's mistake is to confuse events and modules, so that a
state has events called 'Delete-Record', 'Print-Record', and so on.  It can
help to remember that event names must be as general as possible without
losing meaning.</P>

<P>One helpful comparison is to think of events as push-buttons in a pop-up
window box.  Common events are 'Ok' and 'Cancel', 'Print', 'Delete', and
'Help'.  A push-button like 'Delete Next Record' is too specific.</P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page When To Use Libero

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Don't hammer screws, or vice-versa.  If a program is like a building, then
Libero is like an architectural design that automatically forms the
foundation and scaffolding.  In any programming language there are
directions and complexities where Libero is worth using.  Until you get
there, you'll be losing time.</P>

<P>As far as I can see, these are some typical cases where you will profit
from Libero:
<UL>
<LI>If you need to use some kind of pseudocode or other technique to document
the program.  Better to use a dialog - it will always be up to date.  Libero
lets you attach comments anywhere in the dialog.</LI>

<LI>If you are making designs that another programmer will implement (i.e.
you are doing 'analysis').  The programmer does not need to interpret your
design.  Libero will generate a prototype program (with empty stubs for all
modules), so you get feedback on your design right away.</LI>

<LI>If your program analyses text, and you don't have access to tools like
yacc.  It is harder to build a parser using a dialog than to use a parser
generator, but it is still a lot simpler than doing it by hand.  Libero lets
you build really large dialogs.</LI>

<LI>If your program is a communications handler with incoming and outgoing
messages.  A dialog is a perfect way of describing the handling for each
message.  We've used Libero for <EM>complex</EM>TCP/IP servers in this
way.</LI>

<LI>If your program controls a device.  A dialog is a perfect way of
describing the various states that a device can be in, with the handling for
events in each state.</LI>

<LI>If your program runs a complex task on a database; for example,
processing data from a series of tables depending on various criteria and
conditions.  A dialog shows the processing logic clearly, with a state for
each main point in the processing, and an event for each condition or type of
record.</LI>

<LI>If your program is 'just too damn complex'.  It is difficult to keep the
'main logic' separate from the details. Libero does this for you, and then
splits the detailed code into individual modules.  Your program is easy to
understand, easy to maintain, and easy to reuse.</LI>

<LI>If you have to make design a program in several languages, or if you have
people working in several languages.  Libero is language independent.</LI>

<LI>If you are working in some esoteric language that has no support from
third-party tools.  You can build a Libero schema for any language (or I'll
change Libero).</LI>
</UL></P>
