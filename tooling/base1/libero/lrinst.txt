<H2>Getting Your Hands On Libero</H2>

<H3>Availability and Distribution</H3>

<P>Libero is available as a ready-to-run binary kit for various platforms.
You can also download the source kit and re-compile Libero for a specific
platform.

<P>Libero is free software, distributed according to the terms of the
$(*gnugpl="GNU General Public License (GPL)").  This means that
you are free to change and re-distribute Libero, even charge for it, but you
must always make the source code available under the same terms.

<P>The Windows version of Libero is also free software, but does not fall
under the GNU GPL.  You can't get the sources, mostly because it would be
embarrassing.

<P>If you have trouble accessing the iMatix site, or getting your hands on
Libero for any reason, send an e-mail to us at $(*info=imatix.com)
and we will provide you with Libero by e-mail, or on diskette.  We have
used the portable Zip and GNU gzip+tar formats for all archives.

<H3>Documentation</H3>

<P>The Libero User's Guide consists of a set of HTML files that you can
browse on-line or download and browse locally.  You can download:
<UL>
<LI>$(*lrhtml.zip=A set of HTML files) - 190Kb.
<LI>$(*lrfull.zip=One big HTML file) - 73Kb.
</UL>

<H3>Deinstalling Libero</H3>

<P>We made Libero as simple as possible to deinstall.  It does not change
anything in system files, and keeps its own files in the single directory
where you installed it.  To de-install Libero, delete this directory.

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page What You Will Need

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>To install Libero, you'll need:
<OL>
<LI>Either the binary kit for your system, or the $(*lrsrc.zip=source kit)
which is also available as a $(*lrsrc.tgz=GNU gzipped file).
<LI>Infozip $(*info-zip=unzip) to extract the archives.  If you do not have
Infozip unzip for your UNIX or VAX system, you can unzip the files under
MS-DOS or Windows and upload them individually.  Use PKzip version 2.04g or
later or a compatible unzip program.
<LI>Alternatively, for UNIX source installation, GNU gunzip.
<LI>For UNIX or VMS installations from the source kit, an ANSI C compiler to
compile Libero.
<LI>A compiler or interpreter for the language that you want to work in. You
don't necessarily need this on the machine where you want to run Libero; it's
possible to work on one system, then transfer the results to another for
compiling and running.
<LI>The Libero documentation kit.
</OL>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Installing Libero for UNIX

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>To install Libero for a UNIX system you must compile it.  Download one
of:

.-build dir /pub/libero/src lrsrc*.*

<P>You'll need an ANSI C compiler.  The source kit comes with build scripts
for UNIX and VMS.  To unpack the sources in portable Zip format, load
<TT>lrsrc$(versionnbr).zip</TT> into a working directory and extract the
contents using <TT>unzip</TT>:

<PRE>
    $ mkdir temp
    $ mv lrsrc$(versionnbr).zip temp
    $ cd temp
    $ unzip -a lrsrc
    $ chmod +x install
</PRE>

<P>To unpack the sources in GNU gzip format, load
<TT>lrsrc$(versionnbr).tgz</TT> into a working directory and extract the
contents using <TT>gunzip</TT> and <TT>tar</TT>:

<PRE>
    $ mkdir temp
    $ mv lrsrc$(versionnbr).tgz temp
    $ cd temp
    $ gunzip lrsrc
    $ tar -xvf lrsrc$(versionnbr).tar
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>install</TT> script is smart enough to detect the UNIX system and
use appropriate compile switches. It proposes various options: start with
(b)uild to compile and (maybe) install Libero.  You can run Libero as soon as
it is built; you don't need to install it into an install directory.  Run
<TT>install</TT> like this (you may need root access if you want to install
Libero into a system directory):

<PRE>
    $ su root
    $ chmod +x install
    $ ./install
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>install</TT> script uses the Korn shell, which is not available on
all UNIX systems.  You can use <TT>install.sh</TT> instead, which uses the
Bourne shell.  On some UNIX systems the Bourne shell does not support
functions; then this script will not run either.  If you have trouble running
<TT>install</TT> or <TT>install.sh</TT>, try something like this (it's what
the scripts basically try to do):

<PRE>
    $ cc <I>&lt;switches&gt;</I> lr.c lr????.c -o lr
    $ cp lr lrmesg.txt lrschema.* installdir
    $ rm *.o
</PRE>

<P>The <I>&lt;switches&gt;</I> are the compiler switches that do an ANSI C
compile.  Type <TT>man cc</TT> for details.

<P>Once you have built the <TT>lr</TT> file, and installed it and its data
files, you should check that the install directory is on the <TT>PATH</TT>
definition.  By default the install script proposes <TT>/usr/local/bin</TT>
as an install directory.

<P>If you do not like placing non-executable files into a /bin directory, you
can place <TT>lr</TT> there, and the remaining files (<TT>lrmesg.txt,
lrschema.*</TT>) into another directory.  This second directory may be on the
PATH or be defined in another, arbitrary environment variable; for example,
<TT>LRPATH</TT>.  You must then tell Libero which variable you are using with
a command-line switch like: <TT>-path=LRPATH</TT>.  You can also specify the
path literally: <TT>-path=/usr/local/tools/bin</TT>. Place such global
options in the <TT>lr.ini</TT> file.

<P>Note that on UNIX, all filenames are lower-case.  If you do not manage to
install Libero on a non-MS-DOS system, you can always run Libero on a PC,
then upload the generated code.  You can also run Libero for Windows or
MS-DOS, accessing your UNIX disk via a network.  This works pretty well for
many people.

<P>System-specific notes:
<UL>
<LI>Linux, gcc: compile switches: <TT>-pedantic -O2 -Wall -c</TT>.
<LI>HP/UX: compile switches: <TT>-Aa</TT>.
<LI>SunOS, SunC: compile switches: <TT>-O -vc -Xa</TT>.
<LI>SunOS, gcc: see Linux.
<LI>AIX 3.2.5: default compiler switches.  <TT><TT>LIBPATH</TT></TT> must be
set to<TT><TT>/usr/lib</TT></TT> when you link <TT>lr</TT>, or you'll get an
error at runtime.  This appears to be normal compiler behaviour.
</UL>

.page Installing the MS Windows Kit

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Libero for Windows is an interactive editor that provides a drool-proof
interface to the standard Libero code generation functions.  It runs under
Windows 3.1, 95, NT, and other common varieties.  The Libero for Windows kit
comes in a zip file:
<OL>
<LI>$(*lrmswin.zip) - Libero for Windows editor.  Contains the software and
associated files.
</OL>

<P>Install as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Create a directory like <TT>C:\LRWIN</TT> and go there, or go to your
existing Libero directory.
<LI>Unzip <TT>lrmswin.zip</TT>.  This extracts a series of files, including
the main executable - <TT>lrwin.exe</TT>.  Note that the standard Libero
files - e.g.. schema files - are supplied in both versions of Libero
(portable and Windows), so if you have a more recent version of portable
Libero, or have customised schemas, take care when you install Libero for
Windows.
<LI>Open the file manager and drag the <TT>LRWIN.EXE</TT> program into a
program group or onto your speedbar if you use such.
<LI>Double-click on the Libero icon and load in your current dialog file.
The installation directory does not need to be on your path, so long as the
'Path' option in the <I>Options</I> screen points to this directory.
</UL>

<P>Libero for Windows is compatible with standard portable Libero; they share
the same files and general ideas about the world.  However, Libero for
Windows is not distributed under the same terms: it is free software, but you
may not modify it, and you cannot get hold of the sources.

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Installing the MS-DOS Kit

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Download $(*lrmsdos.zip=Libero for MS-DOS).  This was compiled using
Borland Turbo-C.

<P>Create a new directory and extract <TT>lrmsdos.zip</TT> there.  This
creates the set of files that you need to run Libero under MS-DOS.  You must
either add this new directory to your path, or copy certain Libero files into
a directory (like <TT>C:\UTILS</TT>) which is already on your path:
<UL>
<LI><TT>LR.EXE</TT> - the executable Libero program
<LI><TT>LRMESG.TXT</TT> - the message file
<LI><TT>LRSCHEMA.*</TT> - the code-generation schemas
<LI><TT>LR.INI</TT> - default initialisation file
</UL>

<P>The<TT> LR.EXE</TT> file is not too large, and runs in a modest amount of
memory. If you are writing really enormous dialogs, you may want to rebuild
<TT>LR.EXE</TT> from the source kit using a DOS extender.  I haven't tried
this, and I have not heard of anyone running out of memory with Libero under
MS-DOS.  The 32-bit $(*lros2=OS/2 version) should run under MS-DOS.  You may
also want to try the 32-bit MS-DOS version if you run Windows NT or 95.

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Installing the 32-bit MS-DOS Kit

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Download $(*lrdos32.zip=Libero for MS-DOS).  This was compiled
with Microsoft VC 4.0 as a 'console application'.

<P>Create a new directory and extract <TT>lrdos32.zip</TT> there.  This
creates the set of files that you need to run Libero under Windows 95 or
Windows NT in a DOS box.  You must either add this new directory to your
path, or copy certain Libero files into a directory (like <TT>C:\UTILS</TT>)
which is already on your path:
<UL>
<LI><TT>LR32.EXE</TT> - the executable Libero program
<LI><TT>LRMESG.TXT</TT> - the message file
<LI><TT>LRSCHEMA.*</TT> - the code-generation schemas
<LI><TT>LR.INI</TT> - default initialisation file
</UL>
<P>LR32.EXE supports long filenames and mixed-case filenames.

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Installing the OS/2 Kit
.build anchor lros2

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Download $(*lros2.zip=Libero for OS/2) [117Kb].  This was compiled
with EMX 0.9b, using GCC.  Ewen says:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The binary was compiled using EMX 0.9b (I think it should run fine with
EMX 0.9c, the latest version), using:

gcc -O2 -Zomf -s lr????.c -o lr.exe

As usual people will need the EMX runtime libraries to run the executable;
they're on most OS/2 ftp sites including hobbes.nmsu.edu, ftp.cdrom.com,
and ftp.leo.org.  Since quite a few programs need them, most people have
them installed already.  It should run okay with the EMX 0.9b runtime
libraries and the EMX 0.9c runtime libraries (which are the current ones).
<BR>

Oh, BTW, it'll probably run okay under DOS as well (as a 32-bit
version) with either the EMX.EXE extender (included in the runtime DLL
package mentioned above), or with RSX (I think it's called) which is a
DMPI equivilent for EMX.EXE.  Being a 32-bit version it might solve
ram-cramp issues if anyone is having problems.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Create a new directory and extract <TT>lros2.zip</TT> there.  This
creates the set of files that you need to run Libero under OS/2.  You must
either add this new directory to your path, or copy certain Libero files into
a directory (like <TT>C:\UTILS</TT>) which is already on your path:
<UL>
<LI><TT>LR.EXE</TT> - the executable Libero program
<LI><TT>LRMESG.TXT</TT> - the message file
<LI><TT>LRSCHEMA.*</TT> - the code-generation schemas
<LI><TT>LR.INI</TT> - default initialisation file
</UL>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Installing the VAX/VMS Kit

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>To install Libero for Digital OpenVMS you can either download the
$(*lrvax.zip=binary kit for VAX/VMS) or the source kit, if you have
a C compiler (Vax C, Dec C, or GNU gcc).  Currently we do not have a
binary kit for Alpha OpenVMS - you must build from the source kit.
To rebuild from the source kit, download $(*lrsrc.zip=) and place it
into a working directory.  You need the unzip tool to extract it:

<PRE>
    $ set def [.temp]
    $ create/dir []
    $ ... upload LRSRCxxx.ZIP into this directory
    $ unzip -a -o lrsrc$(versionnbr)
    $ @buildvax.txt
</PRE>

<P>If you do not have Unzip on your VMS system, consider installing it - it
is well worth the bother.  You can also unzip the sources on a PC and upload
them from there.

<P>The file <TT>BUILDVAX.TXT</TT> is a procedure that compiles and links
Libero.  Run it (<TT>@buildvax.txt</TT>).  Then copy these files into an
installation directory which is world-readable:
<UL>
<LI><TT>LR.EXE</TT> - the executable Libero program
<LI><TT>LRMESG.TXT</TT> - the message file
<LI><TT>LRSCHEMA.*</TT> - the code-generation schemas
<LI><TT>LR.INI</TT> - default initialisation file
</UL>

<P>To run Libero your <TT>LOGIN.COM</TT> file must include these lines:

<PRE>
    $ define/nolog path "<I>directory</I>";  ! name of Libero directory
    $ lr :== $<I>$disk</I>[<I>directory</I>]lr.exe
</PRE>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Installing the Examples

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>Each example archive is self-complete, and comes with a small
<TT>readme.txt</TT> file.

<P>This is the contents of the examples directory:
.-build dir /pub/libero/example

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Configuring and Testing Libero

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>When you have installed Libero, run the <TT><B>lr</B></TT> command without
arguments.  This should show a page of help.

<P>Try this from the installation directory, then from a different directory.
If Libero cannot find its message file, you'll get an error like this:

<PRE>
C:\CTOOLS\LIBERO&gt;lr
LIBERO v$(version) (c) 1991-97 iMatix <http://www.imatix.com>
Options file 'lr.ini' not found.
Cannot find message file lrmesg on 'PATH' path.
</PRE>

<P>Type 'path' if you're working on MS-DOS, 'echo $PATH' if you're on UNIX,
or 'show log path' if you're on VMS.  Check that the installation directory
is on the path.

<P>Next, type the command 'lr -settings' to see what settings Libero is
using:

<PRE>
C:\CTOOLS\LIBERO&gt;lr -settings
LIBERO v$(version) (c) 1991-97 iMatix <http://www.imatix.com>
