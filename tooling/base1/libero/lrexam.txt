<H2>Libero 'install' Script for UNIX</H2>

<P>The source files for this package are in $(*install.zip).</P>

<P>This is a nice example of a UNIX script that is complex enough to warrant
a dialog.  The script shows a small menu, and does various things depending
on the choice:</P>

<PRE>
Libero installation script                       Version 2.20
-------------------------------------------------------------
This script installs or de-installs Libero on your Unix system.
If you are going to install into a system binary directory you
will need write-access to the system directory.  You can also
run Libero from the current directory.

UNIX system="aix", compiler="cc", options="-O2"
-------------------------------------------------------------

Choose an action:
  (b)uild Libero and optionally install
  (d)e-install Libero
  (c)lean-up current directory
  (q)uit

Choice:
</PRE>

<P>This is the dialog:</P>

<P>The script reads install.cat to tell it which files to handle.
For example, this is the module Compile-All-Subroutines:</P>

<PRE>
######################   COMPILE ALL SUBROUTINES ######################

function compile_all_subroutines
{
    test -f *.o && rm *.o
    for FILE in `awk '/^&.*@c/ {print $2}' $CATALOG`; do
        echo "Compiling $FILE..."
        $CCNAME -c $CCOPTS $FILE
    done
}
</PRE>

<H2>COBOL Picture Parser</H2>

<P>The source files for this package are in $(*picture.zip).</P>

<P>One of my still-unfinished projects is a portable COBOL compiler.  I was
writing a blindingly fast parser when I got sidetracked with Libero at the
start of 1995.  Anyhow, I found that lex was not really good at some of the
syntactic warble that COBOL allows, so I finally wrote a specific analyser.
The COBOL picture is one of the hairier aspects of the language.  I wrote a
function, with a dialog, that was robust and fast.</P>

<P>The function takes a picture string and returns its size, type, and
various other bits of info.  If the picture is not correct it returns an
error message.</P>

<P>It took just over a week, part-time, to write and test this program, so it
can't have been too hard.  I wrote a test program that shoves a load of test
pictures through the function and prints the results.  If you are running
MS-DOS, you can try the testpict program.  It outputs stuff like this:</P>

<PRE>
9(3)                        :                      size=3 numeric
9(3)V                       :                      size=3 numeric
V9(3)                       :                      size=3 numeric 3 decs
9(3)V9(3)9(3)9(3)9(3)9(3)   :                      size=18 numeric 15 decs
9(01                        :                      size=0 undefined
   ^
')' missing after repeat specifier.
ZZZZZ.ZZ9                   : ZZZZZ.....ZZ         size=12 undefined 2 decs
        ^
decimals cannot be partly zero-suppressed
9999,(2).(2)                : 9999,,..             size=8 undefined
         ^
(...) must follow one of: B X Z 0 9 * / + - , $
</PRE>

<P>This package might be useful if you need to analyse COBOL code. There is a
lot of it around (150 Gigalines at last count) so this is not such a
far-fetched idea.</P>

<P>There are also some nice functions in the package; for instance some
pretty fast file i/o code, which is non-portable enough to squeeze the best
out of the C libraries on a number of systems.</P>

<H2>Expression Parser</H2>

<P>The source files for this package are in $(*expr.zip).</P>

<P>The expression parser that I use in the introduction as an example is a
real program that has cropped-up in various places, including in Libero.
Often, when I make a new language schema for Libero, I rewrite the expression
parser as a test.</P>

<P>This package has the same program, more or less, written in C, C++, Java,
COBOL, Rexx, 8086 assembler and Visual Basic.  The $(*etkpak=ETKPAK) archive
at TOSC contains a more complete version of the COBOL program that supports
mathematical functions.</P>

<H2>Configuration Management System</H2>

<P>The source files for this package are in $(*config.zip).</P>

<P>On one project I worked on, a friend of mine, Patrick Bedert, had to write
a configuration management tool.  This tool had to keep track of each of
several thousand programs in the system we were developing.</P>

<P>A program has a life-cycle with various stages: in development, in
testing, in integration, in production, etc.  The developers can work on a
program only when it is in a certain stage.</P>

<P>After some thought, and lunch, we said this: 'Basically the life-cycle or
a program is a state-machine.  The states are the life-cycle stages.  The
events are the actions that the developer wants to, or does, do on the
program.'</P>

<P>So we designed the life-cycle as a Libero dialog.  The events were the
'sensitive' actions which either depended on the life-cycle stage, or which
changed it.  For example, you could only compile a program if you had
previously reserved it for modification.  You could only do this if it was in
the development stage.</P>

<P>We wrote this program as a UNIX shell script.  The script takes a program
and action as argument, and returns an exit code that is 0 (okay) or 1 (not
okay).</P>

<P>Whenever a developer wants to do a sensitive action, the script fires-up
the dialog.  It loads the last state for the program into LR_state, and
converts the action into an event.  The dialog then runs one cycle, and
either accepts the event and perhaps moves to a new state, or rejects the
event.  We save the state for each program in one file.  A small utility,
<TT>gate</TT>, makes sure that this file is never accessed by more than one
process at a time.</P>

<P>I can't supply the actual code, since this belongs to the client who paid
for the work.  However, I provide a small example, control, that should give
you the general idea.  Note that this dialog uses a hacked version of
lrschema.ksh, with some extra code to generate a table of state names.</P>

<P>This was a nice example of using a dialog to describe a real problem that
is normally beyond the scope of software.  It is also the slowest-running
program I have ever seen; one step through the dialog can take days!</P>

<H2>Multithreaded Agent For VAX/ACMS</H2>

<P>The source files for this package are in $(*acms.zip).</P>

<P>One of the most complex programs I ever wrote was a multithreaded terminal
handler for a reservation system running on a Digital VAX/ACMS system.</P>

<P>Digital VAX/ACMS is a transaction processor somewhat akin to IBM's CICS,
or Tuxedo for UNIX.  In the ACMS model, people work on a front-end program
called an 'agent'.  The application programs run on the main system, the
'server'.  This is a good way to split the client-server
responsibilities.</P>

<P>In our project we were unable to use any of the standard Digital agents
(e.g. for DecForms), since we wanted to do our own screen handling.  The only
recourse was to write our own agent. This is easy enough when each user can
run in their own interactive session.  The agent program is then a normal
program which can handle a terminal and talk to ACMS.</P>

<P>The fun starts when you need to connect several hundred users (in our case
up to a thousand).  VMS, like any operating system, cannot handle so many
interactive sessions.  The only valid approach is to handle all the terminals
in a single process.  This means writing a multithreaded program where each
thread manages one terminal.</P>

<P>Perceived wisdom has it that this type of work is deadly difficult, and we
had something of a fight to convince the client that it would actually work.
The schedule was tight, and there was no time (nor will, on my part) to
develop the multithreaded code using conventional techniques.</P>

<P>So, I took the standard Libero C schema and changed it around so that it
generated multithreaded code.  The multithreaded schema actually generates a
tiny kernel that handles the multithreading aspects.  The code you write has
to be careful, as always, but is only a little more complex than normal
single-threaded code.</P>

<P>We beat the schedule, and made the client happy.  The multithreaded agent
is about 3500 lines of code, and a hairy program.  Still, it has run without
trouble for several years, efficiently, and survived several meaty
changes.</P>

<H2>E-mail Robot - ERBOT</H2>

<P>The source files for this package are in $(*erbot.zip).</P>

<P>A fairly complex Awk program, erbot is a kind of remote agent that you
can ask to do work via email.  For instance, you can use erbot to upload
or download files, run commands, etc. all by e-mail.  It is password
protected, and still experimental.</P>

<H2>HTML Preprocessor</H2>

<P>The source files for this package are in $(*htmlpp.zip).</P>

<P>Htmlpp is a preprocessor for HTML files, and is intended to simplify the
task of maintaining large sets of HTML documents.  You provide htmlpp
with a document that is a mix of HTML-tagged text and htmlpp commands.
Htmlpp generates a set of HTML files from that document.</P>

<P>During this process, htmlpp replaces symbols, reads include files, builds
tables of contents, and generally does a lot of otherwise tedious and
error-prone manual work.  To use htmlpp you should be happy writing HTML
with a simple text editor.</P>

<P>This is an old version of htmlpp, since this tool is continually
getting better.  Check-out the links on the iMatix home page for the
latest version of htmlpp.</P>

<H2>Complete Examples Archive</H2>

<P>You can download the complete examples package in $(*complete.zip).
Unzip this and you get all the example archives.  For best results, unzip
each one into a separate directory.</P>
