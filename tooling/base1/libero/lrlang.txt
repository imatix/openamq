<H2>Choosing A Language</H2>

<P>Libero gives you the freedom you get to choose the language
that suits your purpose.  The way I add support for a particular
language is to write a new schema file.  This is a kind of
script that tells Libero how to generate code for that
particular language.  Inevitably, the solution I choose for a
language tends to vary.  For example, the C schema generates a
couple of include files to hold the generated code.  The UNIX
shell schemas in contrast take a source 'module' file and
generate the final script (which you don't work on directly).
</P>

<P>This section documents the special aspects of each language
(ie. schema). Some aspects that apply to all languages:
<UL>
<LI>All the schemas separate the generated code from the
hand-written code.  This means either a strict division into
hand-written files and generated files, or some sleight-of-hand
to get a similar result.  The mechanism varies from language to
language since I use the mechanisms that each language offers
(if any). You should understand which files you get when you
work in a particular language.</LI>

<LI>Most languages provide some form of function or subroutine.
I define one such for each module in the dialog, and you are
free to define your own 'private' functions in the code.  Libero
provides the facility to detect unused ('idle') modules, but for
this the syntax for the module functions must be different to
that for your private functions.  (Otherwise Libero can't tell
the difference, and issues loads of incorrect warning messages.)
In a few languages I did not find an acceptable way of making
the distinction, so the -idle options is disabled.  In the
remaining languages you must take care to follow the recommended
syntax for your private functions.</LI>

<LI>The generated code provides a number of public data items
and functions.  These have the same name in each language, as
far as possible.  Reserved names start with '_LR_' or something
similar.  Never use or refer to these names.</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>Standard Public Names</H2>

<P>All schemas should support these names, which change syntax
according to the -style option:
<UL>
<LI><TT>xxxx_event</TT> - defined for each event in the dialog,
where 'xxxx' is the name used in the dialog.  Use these event
names whenever you need to set the value of the_next_event.</LI>
<LI><TT>the_next_event</TT> - the event for the next state.  Set
this event in one of the action modules, before entering a new
state.</LI>
<LI><TT>terminate_event</TT> - when you assign this to
the_next_event, the state machine halts.  Normally you will do
this in the terminate_the_program module.</LI>
<LI><TT>exception_raised</TT> - if you set this to TRUE, the
dialog engine stops executing the current action list, and goes
into exception handling.  Exceptions are described later.</LI>
<LI><TT>the_exception_event</TT> - before you raise an
exception, set this to the event you want to use as exception
event.  This event must be defined in the current state you are
in, or in the Defaults state.</LI>
<LI><TT>initialise_the_program</TT> - this standard module is
called when the dialog engine starts; here you can access and
check parameters, and set a suitable next event like ok_event.
</LI>
<LI><TT>get_external_event</TT> - this standard module is called
when the dialog needs an event, i.e. when none of the action
modules put anything in the_next_event.</LI>
<LI><TT>raise_exception </TT> - this standard function sets
exception_raised and places the specified event into
the_exception_event.</LI>
</UL></P>

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<DL>
<DT>What Is Awk?</DT>
<DD>Awk is a standard UNIX tool that comes in several flavours -
'old' awk (/bin/awk), new awk (/bin/nawk), GNU gawk (/bin/gawk).
It is a small interpreted language that looks a bit like C, with
a strong flavour of sed pattern matching.  Awk is mostly used to
manipulate text files, but is also fun as a general-purpose
programming language.</DD>
<DT>Portability</DT>
<DD>GNU gawk is available on many platforms. Awk scripts are
highly portable if you don't rely on (UNIX) system-dependent
commands.  GNU Gawk and new awk share most functions.</DD>
<DT>Pros and Cons</DT>
<DD>Pros: Awk is versatile and easy to learn; GNU gawk is freely
available; Awk is an interpreted language and looks a bit like
C.  Cons: Awk is a simple language, not powerful enough for
industrial-strength work; it's interpreted - slower than C but
faster than a shell; it looks a bit like C.</DD>
<DT>How To Get It</DT>
<DD>On UNIX boxes, <TT>awk</TT> or <TT>nawk</TT>. On other
systems, get GNU gawk.</DD>

<H4>Notes</H4>
<P>My awk programs fall between two extremes.  At the one end is
a 'filter', to process text according to patterns in each line.
This is excellent for smallish problems.  As the problem grows,
I need to read other files 'on the side', and the logic of my
awk program grows until a large part of it is sitting in the
BEGIN or END blocks.  Eventually I find that I am perhaps
reading and writing several files, so I take the plunge and
rewrite the program to handle all files with explicit 'getline'
calls.  The awk program is no longer a filter, but a stand-alone
program that resembles a classic procedural program.  Of course
at this point my Libero hindbrain wakes up and starts muttering
'an' whaddabout Libero, eh?'.</P>

<P>When I wrote the awk schema, I started with the Visual Basic
schema. Bizzarely enough this language resembles awk most in
terms of structure and possibilities.  I've started thinking of
awk as a kind of 'Basic for UNIX'.</P>

<P>Awk presents some of the same difficulties as Visual Basic.
There is no 'include' statement to take an external file as part
of the program.  The UNIX shells have the same problem.</P>

<P>&lt;GRIPE&gt;Since awk is tokenised, then executed, messieurs
A, W, and K had no real excuse for omitting an 'include'
facility.&lt;/GRIPE&gt;</P>

<P>I really don't want to look at the chunk of code that Libero
generates, so I always try to find a way to separate this from
the hand-written code I am working on.  If the language provides
an 'include' statement, I place the generated code in an include
file.  This works great in serious compiled languages which all
have something like this.  You change the dialog, regenerate
the code, and recompile.  At any time you can change the
program and recompile without having to run Libero again.</P>

<P>For the awk schema I used another technique: you work in a
separate 'module' file (<TT>myprog.mod</TT>).  Libero combines
the module file with the generated program to create a final
program, which you don't change. This effectively hides the
generated code, but introduces an extra step: each time you
change the .mod file you must re-run Libero to create the final
script.  In effect, Libero acting as a preprocessor in place of
the missing 'include' statement.</P>

<P>Notice the slightly unusual format of a generated module
header:</P>

<PRE>
function module_function_name \
 ( local_var,... ) {
    ...
}</PRE>

<P>I break the function header over two lines so that you can
add local variables easily if you need to.  Libero recognises
the first line as a module header, and does not look at the next
line with the local variables. The unusual format also
distinguishes module functions from private functions, so
ensures that the -idle option works correctly.</P>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<DL>
<DT>What Is C?</DT>
<DD>C is part of UNIX originally, now almost a universal language. It is a
very general purpose language, and typically used for systems programming.
ANSI C is a widely supported standard.</DD>
<DT>Portability</DT>
<DD>ANSI C compilers are available on (almost) all platforms. ANSI C programs
can be highly portable if you eschew compiler extensions, and don't rely on
libraries that are not portable.  Some UNIX vendors include non-ANSI
compilers but charge extra for ANSI C compilers.  Luckily the GNU gcc
compiler is excellent and ported to most UNIX systems.</DD>
<DT>Pros and Cons</DT>
<DD>Pros: C is flexible and widely known; it is a small and clean language.
C compilers are generally well-tuned and sometimes exceptionally good.  Cons:
no easy string handling; sloppy programmers write horrendous C code.</DD>
<DT>How To Get It</DT>
<DD>How to get it On UNIX boxes, 'cc', or 'gcc'. GNU gcc is widely available
and well-regarded.  Commercial C compilers are available for almost all
platforms from mainframes to embedded systems.</DD>

<H4>Notes</H4>

<P>I've used Libero to help me write C programs for a few years.  It would be
false to say I used Libero all the time; this is simply not the case.  For
example, I wrote Libero in C: there are 12 separate source files, and four of
these have dialogs.  I used a dialog whenever I had a single function that
got rather complex. In Libero, this happens to be in:
<OL>
<LI>the module that parses and loads a dialog (<TT>lrload</TT>);</LI>
<LI>the code generator module, which scans the schema and interprets the
simple language embedded in the schema (<TT>lrcode</TT>);</LI>
<LI>the two modules that evaluate expressions (<TT>lrcalc</TT> and
<TT>lreval</TT>).</LI>
</OL></P>

<P>It's probably no coincidence that all these modules do some kind of
parsing.  Libero is a code generator, so it's normal that the most complex
modules are parsers.  As a consultant, I've written some profoundly complex C
programs using Libero.  In at least one case I still don't see any other way
that I could have done the project.</P>

<P>When you write a C program using Libero, you tend to use a lot of
source-local variables.  This is disturbing to some programmers, who reckon
that a program must consist of lots of internested modules that hide data
from each other.  Sure, this is one way of managing complexity.  Still,
modules in a Liberated program aren't nested; they all sit at the same level
below the dialog.  They all share (mostly) a common set of data objects.  In
real programs this seems to work nicely, so if you have problems with it,
just close your eyes the first few times.</P>

.page The COBOL Language

.build anchor cobol
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<DL>
<DT>What Is COBOL?</DT>
<DD>COBOL is a standard language for business software, a job that it does
well.  It is heavily used in the mainframe world.  COBOL has an undeserved
reputation for inefficiency, and a deserved reputation for verbosity.  Today,
many COBOL applications are being moved from mainframes to UNIX boxes.</DD>
<DT>Portability</DT>
<DD>Deaf, dumb, blind COBOL programs can be very portable. Otherwise you can
use external libraries to achieve 100% portability (catch: you may have to
write these libraries yourself).</DD>
<DT>Pros and Cons</DT>
<DD>Pros: easy to use and teach. An excellent language for mediocre
developers, which includes me at least two days of the week.  Cons: Tends to
encourage large, monolithic programs.  Like unreadable C code, this is a
question of discipline.  COBOL provides no way to define data types directly,
and has a verbose and over-rich syntax.  COBOL compilers are often
unimpressive.  This is actually putting it mildly: on several systems that
I've worked on, a simple loop in COBOL runs from 100 to 1000 times slower
than the same loop coded in assembler.  I've seen just one COBOL compiler
(Versions 2 and 3 of Realia) that could produce truly excellent code.</DD>
<DT>How To Get It</DT>
<DD>No free implementations exist, despite various attempts -- including one
by me: if a COBOL compiler is Mt. Everest, I got as far as London Heathrow
airport.  You need to find a commercial COBOL vendor for your system.</DD>

<H4>Notes</H4>

<UL>
<LI>The dialog file can't have same name as the program (on some systems the
extension for a program and a copy book is the same); the schema gives an
error message in this case.  I suggest you use the <TT>-plusd</TT> option in
your dialog.</LI>
<LI>Since there is no way to distinguish the dialog paragraphs ('modules')
from private paragraphs, the schema turns-off idle module checking.</LI>
<LI>With some compilers (typically on IBM systems) you need to add a QUOTES
option to compile the generated code.  The generated code uses quotes, not
apostrophes - this is more portable, though maybe unusual for IBM'ers.</LI>
<LI>There is no FEEDBACK variable or RAISE-EXCEPTION function, in contrast
with most other schemas.</LI>
<LI>Assumes the old-fashioned 80-column format with 6-digit sequence number
and 8-character comment at right-hand side. Generates upper-case text.</LI>
</UL>

<P>COBOL has a reputation for encouraging large unwieldy programs.  This is
justified to the extent that the language is verbose.  I think it's more due
to the fact that COBOL programs tend to be written and maintained under
particular pressures: get it working, now, and who cares if it is a little
unwieldy.  You don't often see COBOL code competing on the open market for
software where program size and speed are important.</P>

<P>People working in COBOL expect monsters, so often get them. Now, I've
spent a lot of my life writing COBOL - perhaps half a million lines or so,
and I know that this unnecessary suffering. Of course it is possible to write
clean, organised, commented code without Libero.  It is just a lot more
effort, and I'm lazy.</P>

<P>This schema is for batch programs and subroutines.  Batch programs are
often the largest and most complex COBOL programs, and often benefit from a
dialog.  I've not seen a lot of subroutines that really needed a a dialog;
the expression calculator is one example.  Also, if you split a large batch
program into smaller subroutines, these can be complex enough to warrant a
dialog.  Very roughly, I would reckon that a COBOL program of more than 1000
lines is worth building around a dialog.</P>

<LI>You must remember to assign events and other variables as follows:
<TT>the_next_event=$some_event</TT>.  If you make the common mistake of
forgetting the '$', the results are interesting but not useful.  The schema
checks against this error, at a slight cost in runtime.  You can skip these
checks by using the -nocheck option. The BASH language lets you declare
numeric variables explicitly, so this check is not required in the
lrschema.bsh schema.</LI>

<LI>Your <TT>.mod</TT> file is not copied entirely, but in sections. The
script schemas extract three sections marked with the keywords &lt;HELP&gt;
to &lt;END&gt;, &lt;DATA&gt; to &lt;END&gt;, and &lt;CODE&gt; to
&lt;END&gt;.  You will see :include commands in the schemas that do this.
The final &lt;END&gt; is optional, and probably best to ignore.</LI>

<LI>The &lt;HELP&gt; section is copied to the header of the script. Each line
in this section should start with '#'.  Some of my scripts are
self-anotating: if run with '-h' as argument, they do something like
this:

<PRE>
    expand $0 | egrep "^# |^#$" | cut -c 4-80 | more
</PRE></LI>

<LI>The module <TT>Initialise_the_program</TT> gets the command-line
arguments; ie. it can refer to $1, $2, in the normal way.</LI>

<LI>The <TT>script_name</TT> variable contains the command-line variable $0.
You could put something like this in initialise_the_program:

<PRE>
    if test "$1" = "-h"; then
       expand $script_name | egrep "^# |^#$" | \
       cut -c 4-80 | more
       exit
   fi
</PRE></LI>
</OL>

<P>Also note that:
<OL>
<LI>It is sometimes useful to start a script using the <TT>.</TT> operator.
For instance, to trace a script you could use these commands:<BR>
<TT>set -x; . scriptname</TT><BR>
If such a script ends with <TT>exit</TT> (and the generated ones do), you
exit the current shell. If it's your main shell, you are logged-out.  To
avoid this, enclose the entire command in parentheses:<BR>
<TT>(set -x; . scriptname)</TT>
or run a sub-shell first.</LI>

<LI>The auto-annotating function explained above won't work if you run the
script using the <TT>.</TT> operator ($0 becomes the name of the
shell...).</LI>

<LI>These shell script schemas are somewhat slow.  I optimised the code to
use as many internal commands as possible in place of external commands.
This cut the time spent in the dialog manager code by 60% over the first
version.  The bash and ksh versions are the most efficient; bsh does not have
a <TT>let</TT> command, so I need to use the clumsy <TT>a = `expr 1 + 1`</TT>
to increment a variable.  The bash shell version is the cleanest, since I can
use <TT>declare</TT> to define numeric variables.  Any attempt to assign text
to a numeric variable gives an explict shell error message.</LI>

<LI>I use a function <TT>LR_idx</TT> to access arrays of numbers by shifting
and returning a numeric value.  This is the fastest method I could find, and
it works in all three shell languages. As a consequence, there is a limit of
254 events (255 is the terminate_event).</LI>

<LI>If you are doing heavy shell-type programming, consider using Perl.</LI>

<DT>What Is Java?</DT>
<DD>If you've been living in a cave for the last few years you
might have missed the news that Java (also called 'Basic for
Toasters') is going to replace every other language out there.
This is perhaps a little exaggerated, but Java is a very
interesting language all the same.  Java is not too complex,
though you need to learn quite a lot about various 'class
libraries' before you can do anything useful with it.  The best
use for Java right now is to write portable 'plug-ins' that work
with any recent web browser on many platforms.</DD>

<DT>Portability</DT>
<DD>Java is in principle 100% portable, but this claim may be
qualified as Java gets implemented on more systems.</DD>

<DT>Pros and Cons</DT>
<DD>Pros: Java is similar to C++, though cleaner.  It's portable
and works well with post-1996 Internet browsers.
Cons: it's interpreted, so slowish.  You will spend some time
learning to do anything useful with it.</DD>

<DT>How To Get It</DT>
<DD>You can download Java kits from Sun; you can buy various
Java development environments.</DD>

<DT>Libero Supports</DT>

<H4>Notes</H4>
<P>This schema is still in a beta state; I've not used it in any real
program. However, if I ever have to write a setup script in this language,
this is the way to go.</P>

<P>When I started writing a setup program for 'Libero for Windows', I got
hold of the Microsoft Setup Toolkit, and discovered the joys of writing a
setup script.  The language is the cut-down Basic that was used in the MS
Test product: TestBasic version 1.0.  I call this almost-language MST.  At
least, unlike Visual Basic, MST supports an include statement.  So, the MST
schema puts the generated code into an .inc file.</P>

<P>The setup toolkit documentation suggests that you draw a flowchart of the
various stages of your install procedure, then code this into an MST program.
Hmm.  :-(  I hate flowcharts, for one thing.  For another, I have a much
simpler and useful technique up my sleeve, so some quick work on a schema,
and 'wallop!'.  MST, please meet Mr. Turing.</P>

<P>As it happens, I then decided that I did not want to use an MST setup
program, did not want to start designing dialog boxes and resources.  Now the
Libero for Windows installation package is a .zip file that you expand into
the directory of your choice, full stop.  Still, the MST schema is there and
it works, barring the odd lazy bug.</P>

<LI>The <TT>.int</TT> interpreter calls the <TT>.bas</TT> source file via a

<LI>All functions are private; this allows several Liberated programs in the

can't understand who would write or use this shell.  Get Perl, and use that
instead.  Flames welcome. Nuff sed.</P>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<DL>
<DT>What Is Bourne Shell?</DT>
<DD>The Bourne shell (/bin/sh) is the original UNIX shell. It is basic and
slow.  Most systems provided an extended version that supports functions.</DD>
<DT>Portability</DT>
<DD>There are at least two flavours of Bourne shell; with and without
functions.  The simplest is portable to probably all UNIX systems; the
extended Bourne shell to most UNIX systems (I know only one that does not
provide it: NeXT.</DD>
<DT>Pros and Cons</DT>
<DD>Pros: Most standard shell. Cons: functionally poor; like all shells,
slower than Awk or Perl or C.</DD>
<DT>How To Get It</DT>
<DD>Should be installed on your UNIX system.</DD>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<DL>
<DT>What Is Korn Shell?</DT>
<DD>The Korn shell (/bin/ksh) is the most advanced 'standard' UNIX shell. It
extends the Bourne shell with lots of nice features, and is a lot faster.</DD>
<DT>Portability</DT>
<DD>The Korn shell is standard when available, but is not supplied on all UNIX
boxes.</DD>
<DT>Pros and Cons</DT>
<DD>Pros: supplied on most UNIXes; your scripts will run quickly. Cons: like
all shells, slower than Awk or Perl or C.</DD>
<DT>How To Get It</DT>
<DD>Korn shell is available in a public-domain version (by Eric Baalberger)
for Linux.</DD>

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Overview</H3>

<DL>
<DT>What Is 80x86 Assembler?</DT>
<DD>This is the native language for most of the world's PCs. It is fast and
dangerous.  It gives you a 5-to-10 performance improvement over the best C
compilers.</DD>
<DT>Portability</DT>
<DD>Very portable to all compatible CPU's. Comes in various varieties,
following the evolution in 80x86 CPU's.  The lowest-common denominator is the
16-bit 8086.</DD>
<DT>Pros and Cons</DT>
<DD>Pros - can't get it faster; can't make it smaller. Cons: multiply your
development and maintenance costs by ten.</DD>
<DT>How To Get It</DT>
<DD>There are various free and shareware assemblers around, which are not all
compatible in terms of syntax.  The 'standards' are the Borland TASM and
Microsoft MASM products.</DD>
<DT>Libero Supports</DT>
<DD>MS MASM 5.0: .com files, .exe files, and subroutines.</DD>

'xxxx' is the name used in the dialog.</LI>
<LI><TT>terminate_event</TT> - macro: when you move this to the_next_event,
the state machine halts.</LI>

<LI><TT>echo</TT> - function: prints null-terminated message at DS:SI.  The
sequence \n is treated as newline.  All registers are safe except flags.</LI>
<LI><TT>echoch</TT> - function: prints character in AL using BIOS tty
function.  Does not change any registers except the flags.</LI>
<LI><TT>echonum</TT> - function: displays the value in AX as a signed decimal
number with one leading space, and optional sign.  Does not change any
registers except the flags.  Number is in range 32768..32767</LI>

<LI>Assemble and link as an .EXE file:
<PRE>
    masm $source;
    link $source;
</PRE></LI>
<LI>Code, data, and stack each have their own segment.  <TT>DS</TT> and
<TT>ES</TT> both point to the data segment.  Default stack size is 1024; you
can ask for a larger stack using '-opt:stack_size=nnnn'.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>Assemble and link with a large-model calling program
<PRE>
    masm $source;

<LI>Code, data, and stack each have their own segment.  <TT>DS</TT> and
<TT>ES</TT> both point to the data segment.  Stack is provided by calling
program.</LI>

<LI>The <TT>FUNCTION_OPEN</TT> macro defines the interface between your
function and calling programs.  The default is for C programming. In the
generated skeleton program, change the definition of <TT>function</TT> to
suit the name of your function.  Note that it must start with '_' for C
programming.  Define any parameters following the example param1 shown.  The
parameters to a function are passed on the stack starting at &lt;6[BP]&gt;.
Don't make these changes to the skeleton, but to the program that Libero
generates for you the first time.</LI>

<H4>Programming with all models</H4>

<UL>
<LI>Do not rely on registers being safe between modules.  The dialog code
uses these freely without saving them.</LI>
<LI>You can freely use any of the working registers (AX, BX, CX, DX, ES, DS,
DI, SI) in a module function.</LI>
<LI>In a LSUB model program, do not change BP.</LI>
