<H2>Summary</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Libero is a Programmer's Tool and Code Generator.  You
define the high-level logic of a problem as a diagram: Libero
generates the code to implement this logic.  Your applications
are easier to write, more robust, easier to understand. Libero
uses a finite-state machine as the underlying model.</LI>
<LI>Libero generates code in these languages: C, C++, Java,
Perl, Awk, 80x86 assembler, COBOL, MS Visual Basic, MS Test
Basic, UNIX C Shell, UNIX Korn Shell, UNIX Bourne Shell, GNU
Bash Shell, Rexx, PL/SQL, and PHP.  You can extend Libero support
to other languages via external <EM>schema</EM> files.</LI>
<LI>Libero runs on: UNIX (tested on Linux, HP/UX, SunOS, Irix,
AIX, Solaris), MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Digital Open-VMS, OS/2.  It
is in theory portable to any ANSI C compiler; the Libero sources
are part of the package.</LI>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;Laziness</P>

<P>The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce
overall energy expenditure.  It makes you write labour-saving
programs that other people will find useful, and document what
you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about
it.  Hence the first great virtue of a programmer.&quot;</P>

<P>Larry Wall [Programming Perl, Larry Wall and Randal. L.
Schwartz, 1992 O'Reilly &amp; Associates, Inc., page

<H3>How It All Started</H3>

<P>In 1982, as a student, I got into games programming as a way
of making some money.  I skipped the build-it-yourself-from-an-
old-TV-screen-and-a-hex-keypad phase of people computers, and
jumped straight into the world of ready-to-go colour and sound.
My first PC had 5K of RAM, and 25x22 colour video.  It could
beep in three-part harmony.  My first published work was an
article that explained how to tweak the video output to 30x33
(hi-resolution!).  Soon I was writing sprite painters, assembly
libraries for sound and graphics, even languages to replace the
built-in Basic.  Anything to let me write my games faster and
better.  Before I knew what had hit me, I was hooked into the
cycle of writing tools to improve the world I lived in.</P>

<P>I haven't written a game for a long time, but I've continued
writing tools. Libero is one of the best - it's simple, clean,
portable, and has hit the mark so often that I feel it's unfair
to keep it for myself.</P>

<P>The ideas behind Libero evolved in Brussels, Belgium during
the 1980's and 90's.  I worked with $(*leif=Leif Svalgaard), on
what we would now call a CASE tool - $(*etk=ETK) - that let
COBOL programmers produce clean, portable code instead of the
mess we generally saw.  One of the key techniques we used was a
programming method based on finite state machines. Historically,
the first real programs that used finite state machines were
compilers.  In 1967, Peter Naur describes a new way of using
FSMs (which he refers to as a Turing machine approach) in a
compiler, and shows how they simplify error checking.  He goes
on to say:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&quot;The above description has stressed the checking aspect
of the Turing machine approach.  However, an equally important
aspect is the ease with which arbitrary actions may be
specified.  By using this approach it is usually possible to
avoid tests in individual actions to a surprisingly high degree.
This in our experience is a very effective way of reducing the
bulk and execution time of the translator algorithm.&quot; </P>
<P>[Annual Review in Automatic Programming, &quot;Design Of The
Gier Algol Compiler&quot;, Ed. Richard Goodman; 1964 Pergamon
Press, page 77.]</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ETK provides an interactive editor that you use to describe
the logic of the program as a FSM.  This approach encourages you
to think about the complete problem.  You describe everything
that can happen, and how the program should react.  The end-
result looks a little like a flow-chart, but has more arrows,
and fewer different kinds of boxes.  The value of this approach
is that you can abstract a complex problem using the restricted
semantics of a FSM.  In the same way that a <B>While</B>
statement is less powerful but more useful than a <B>Goto</B>, a
FSM is less powerful but more useful than a structured
programming approach for describing complex problems.  Leif
Svalgaard once said: &quot;the issue is not one of power, but
coping with the human difficulty in understanding complex
structures&quot;.
</P>

<P>Now, in a conventional state machine, these boxes are given
numbers, and the programmer builds some tables that encode the
arrows.  To make such a table by hand - or, just as bad, encode
the table directly in the logic of the program, using GOTOs - is
a Bad Thing, since the result is near to impossible to maintain.
The neat part of our solution was that we took the textual
description (called a 'dialog'), and generated the mystical
tables directly as COBOL code.  This is a Good Thing, since the
original dialog is easy to change, and suddenly becomes
excellent (and always accurate) documentation.  In 1992 I began
working as a consultant, and found that I wanted to use these
techniques in my work.  I was writing in C, so I threw together
a code generator that could output C code using the same dialog
methodology I was used to.  I called this tool 'Libero' after
the guy who runs around the sidelines at the football/soccer
pitch doing all the dirty work.  My first serious job was a
bunch of TCP/IP clients and servers.  It was nice to come back
to the place three years later and find that the guy maintaining
my work had only found one bug, and was happy to go into the
programs.  He said that the dialogs made them easy to understand
and modify.</P>

<P>This kind of experience convinced me that there was real
value in this tool. I've written lots of cute programs that are
useful for my own needs, but that just don't hack it in the real
world.  Libero is different.</P>

<P>The first public release of Libero (1.7) generated C code
using an external model, a kind of script called a 'schema'.  I
had a couple of schemas; one for ANSI C code, and one for
multithreaded DEC/VMS code.  I released version 2.0 onto the Net
after adding schemas for UNIX scripts. This release gave me a
lot of feedback, and I rewrote the code-generator again to make
it much more generic.  The current version 2.11 has a lot more
language schemas and a lot fewer bugs, plus a front-end for MS-
Windows.</P>

<P>I hope to continue in both these directions.  Libero has
become a tool that lets you switch between languages at ease.
The first step is to accept the state-machine as a valid method
for program development.  This takes a little effort, but I hope
that the examples which follow will help convince you.  The
second step is to see that this method is language-independent.
You can write a program in C, then recode it in Perl without
changing its design.</P>

<P>A hypothetical development team might write mainframe
business applications in COBOL, tools in Perl, servers in C,
batch scripts in Korn shell, Web clients in Java.  Yet instead
of a team fragmented into  specialists in each domain, you would
have a team that enjoys a common design  technique and who can
quickly take on each other's work.  In practice, you also get a
certain communality of programming style, which disturbs
language  purists.  However, I like it when - say - a COBOL
programmer that knows only  Libero take a C program written with
Libero and says: &quot;But it looks like  COBOL!&quot;.  Of
course neither the Libero+C nor Libero+COBOL programs look
anything like 'COBOL'.</P>

<H3>Learning To Use Libero</H3>

<P>I've not found a quick way to convey the true nature of state
machine programming.  In my experience, it invariably takes a
few days of practice. After three or four days' exposure to the
idea there is a near-audible 'click!' and something in the brain
connects all the pieces together and you go 'Oh, it's like
THAT!'.  Maybe people cultured on event-driven programming will
get it faster.</P>

.page The Coke Machine Example

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>The coke machine (once awake and gently humming) sits against the wall,
waiting.  There is a theory about this humming business, notably that coke
machines have terrible memories, and can't remember the words.  A second
school of thought says that the coke machines are humming because they're
thinking about all the terrible things they're going to do to humans with
crow bars.  A third school of thought reckons that the coke machines have
already done something, and are humming because they thought it was really
funny.  Like all coke machines, it's very good at waiting, due to Natural
Selection.  All the impatient proto-coke machines ran off screaming 'I can't
take it anymore' and were crunched underfoot by brontosaurii back in the
mists of prehistory.</P>

<P>A punter arrives with a handful of loose change.  The coke-machine
(covered by the modern and tasteful metal grid that serves both as a
defensive covering and as an attraction for coke machines of the opposite
sex) moves into 'attention' mode.  When it hears the clink of tasty cash,
rather that the ominous clunk of a heavy crow-bar, it relaxes into 'ready
mode'.  The machine is now ready to handle any eventuality, so long as it
includes coinage.</P>

<P>As the last coin falls and the punter presses the button labelled
'healthie waye sparkling spring water', the machine considers the
possibilities.  Should it play dead, and just take the punter's money?
Or maybe it can substitute a can of 30% sucrose 'sweeto-sap'?  Finally
it rumbles once, then again for added effect, then excretes a can of water.
It munches the coins, then settles back against the wall, quietly humming
again.</P>

<P>Just to prove that you can describe <I>any</I> sequence of events, however
improbable, with a state machine, here goes.  (The observant reader will have
skipped to the next section by now, realising that this one is not worth the
paper it's printed on.  If you're reading this on-line, then this section is
not worth the phosphor it's been digitised, rasterised, and sprayed by an
electronic beam gun onto.)  Act 1, scene 1 has our protagonist against the
wall, trying to remember the words of the song.  Our coke-machine hero is
normally OK; if something went terribly wrong with the rehearsals (e.g. a
dinosaur got sucked through a five-dimensional space-time vortex stretched
between the middle terrasic to five minutes into rehersals; the dinosaur a
little off balance after the trip puts down its left foot, and 'crunch'...),
it might be Dead, in which case we have to call the whole thing off.  We'll
call this scene 'Should Be Gently Humming'...</P>

<PRE>
Should-Be-Gently-Humming:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Wait-For-A-Punter
    (--) Dead                       -&gt;
          + Stop-The-Programme
</PRE>

<P>The coke machine has been waiting, perhaps for days, for a punter to come
along.  When the footprints fade in from the distance (a coke machine's ears
are always against the ground, which explains why you rarely find coke
machines on wet or dirty surfaces), the machine hears either a cashy 'clink'
or a more sinister 'clunk':</P>

<PRE>
Something-Happened:
    (--) Clink                      -&gt; Before-Cooperating
          + Accept-Punter's-Cash
          + Wait-For-Punter's-Choice
          + Shall-We-Cooperate?
    (--) Clunk                      -&gt;
          + Exit-Stage-Left-Running
          + Stop-The-Programme
</PRE>

<P>The advent of a 'Clunk' tells the machine to beat it, smartly.  If a
'Clink' happened, the machine goes on to think about a game plan for the
coming few minutes.  It accepts whatever spare change the punter has to
spare, then pounces, metaphorically:</P>

<PRE>
Before-Cooperating:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Cooperate
          + Consider-Punter's-Choice
    (--) Nasty                      -&gt; Let's-Be-Nasty
          + Consider-Punter's-Choice
    (--) Play-Dead                  -&gt; Something-Happened

          + Switch-On-The-Lights
          + Wait-For-A-Punter
</PRE>

<P>If it's in a good mood, the machine ejects more or less the drink that the
punter chose:</P>

<PRE>
Cooperate:
    (--) Coke                       -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Eject-Can-Of-Coke

          + Wait-For-A-Punter
    (--) Juice                      -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Eject-Can-Of-Juice
          + Wait-For-A-Punter
    (--) Sweeto-Sap                 -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Eject-Can-Of-Sweeto-Sap
          + Wait-For-A-Punter

          + Switch-Off-All-Lights
          + Stop-The-Programme
</PRE>

<P>If the coke machine's pretty weak internal moral system failed, it
supplies the opposite of whatever the punter wanted:</P>

<PRE>
Let's-Be-Nasty:
    (--) Coke                       -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Eject-Can-Of-Juice
          + Wait-For-A-Punter
    (--) Spring-Water               -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Eject-Can-Of-Sweeto-Sap
          + Wait-For-A-Punter
    (--) Juice                      -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Eject-Can-Of-Coke
          + Wait-For-A-Punter
    (--) Sweeto-Sap                 -&gt; Something-Happened
          + Eject-Can-Of-Spring-Water
          + Wait-For-A-Punter

          + Switch-Off-All-Lights
          + Stop-The-Programme
</PRE>

<P>This diagram is a little complex for a first example.  Remember however,
that we are modelling a rich behaviour pattern that took several hundreds of
millions of years to evolve.  Real software is usually developed much faster,
and should therefore be much simpler, only it isn't.</P>

.page Example of Using a Telephone

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>In a more technical example, we'll model the steps we take in using making
a telephone call.  By convention, the first state is <TT>After-Init</TT>.
Another convention is to use <TT>Terminate-The-Program</TT> to halt the
dialog.</P>

<P>After initialisation (I would recommend a good coffee or a decent beer,
depending on the time of day), we pick-up the handset, and listen to the
dialing tone.</P>

<PRE>
After-Init:
    (--) Ok                          -&gt; Want-Dialing-Tone
          + Pick-Up-Telephone-Handset
          + Listen-For-Dialing-Tone
    (--) Error                       -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>This leads us to the state <TT>Want-Dialing-Tone</TT>.  Here we handle
each of the possible events produced by <TT>Listen-For-Dialing-Tone</TT>.
Let's look at these in detail:
<UL>
<LI><B>Ok</B> We have a dialing tone, so we can dial the number.  This
is the normal, expected event.</LI>
<LI><B>Silent, no tone</B> The telephone exchange is having a hard day, or
someone unplugged the phone.  Or maybe a ninja attack team has cut the phone
cables and is at this moment sneaking up the stairs and AAAARGH...  In this
simple example we loop forever; in a real program we would allow a limited
number of attempts.</LI>
<LI><B>Voices on the line</B> Some other member of the household is making
the phone company richer.  We apologise and forget it.</LI>
<LI><B>Modem noise</B> - the young bro' is downloading some more bootleg
GIF's.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>We give each of these events a short snappy name and list them in a
reasonable order.  Like a 'case' statement, the actual order makes no
difference to the machine, but helps the person reading the dialog.
Typically we put the most frequent or expected events first, with the more
bizarre ones at the end.  Each event provokes one or more <I>actions</I> that
correspond to <I>modules</I> of code.  A module can be a <I>function</I>,
<I>procedure</I>, <I>subroutine</I>, <I>paragraph</I>, etc., depending on the
programming language.  A module is where you do the real work.</P>

<PRE>
Want-Dialing-Tone:
    (--) Ok                          -&gt; Want-Ringing-Tone
          + Dial-Required-Number
          + Listen-For-Ringing-Tone
    (--) Silent                      -&gt; Want-Dialing-Tone
          + Put-Down-Telephone-Handset
          + Pick-Up-Telephone-Handset
          + Listen-For-Dialing-Tone
    (--) Voices                      -&gt;
          + Apologise-Telephone-Busy
          + Put-Down-Telephone-Handset
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Modem                       -&gt;
          + Put-Down-Telephone-Handset
          + Apologise-Cutting-Modem
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>Here we are waiting for a ringing tone.  We can reuse some of the event
names - <TT>Ok</TT>, <TT>Silence</TT>, <TT>Voices</TT> - from the previous
state.  This makes the generated code smaller, and is nice for the reader,
since there are fewer names to remember:</P>

<PRE>
Want-Ringing-Tone:
    (--) Ok                          -&gt; Want-Answer
          + Listen-For-Answer
    (--) Silence                     -&gt; Want-Dialing-Tone
          + Put-Down-Telephone-Handset
          + Pick-Up-Telephone-Handset
          + Listen-For-Dialing-Tone
    (--) Engaged                     -&gt; After-Engaged

          + Put-Down-Telephone-Handset
          + Pick-Up-Telephone-Handset
          + Listen-For-Dialing-Tone
</PRE>

<P>You get the picture.  The remaining states map out the rest of the
conversation.  The next state has an event, <TT>Doorbell</TT>, that is not
produced by any previous module, but that can happen at any time.  We call
this an <I>exception event</I>, and we add the handling for it in the state
where it can happen:</P>

</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Defaults</TT> state is special; we never come here explicitly.
Rather, the state holds events that are implicitly valid in any other state.
Here we say that whenever the <TT>Doorbell</TT> event strikes, we put the
phone down and beat it doorwards.  Note that the <TT>Doorbell</TT> event is
handled explicitly in <TT>Want-Answer</TT> - the action in that state is a
little different from the other states.</P>

<PRE>
Defaults:

<H3>Serious Stuff: Events and Names</H3>

<P>Now I want to show how an action module 'produces' an event.  Libero
provides a standard variable called <TT>The-Next-Event</TT>.  An event like
'Ok' is actually called <TT>Ok-Event</TT> in the program (Libero tacks-on
'-Event' for you).  This is how you would set <TT>The-Next-Event</TT> in
various languages:
<UL>
<LI>C/C++: <TT>the_next_event = ok_event;</TT></LI>
<LI>80x86 assembler: <TT>mov the_next_event,ok_event</TT></LI>
<LI>UNIX Korn Shell: <TT>the_next_event=$ok_event</TT></LI>
<LI>Perl: <TT>the_next_event = $ok_event;</TT></LI>
<LI>COBOL: <TT>MOVE OK-EVENT TO THE-NEXT-EVENT</TT></LI>
<LI>Visual Basic: <TT>the_next_event = ok_event</TT></LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Libero applies this rule: <I>at least </I>one of the action modules for an
event must supply a value for <TT>The-Next-Event</TT>.  If no value for
<TT>The-Next-Event</TT> is supplied, the dialog halts with some kind of error
message.</P>

<P>The names of events and action modules can take various forms, depending
on the language and your preferences.  For example, the C/C++ code could take
any of these forms:
<UL>
<LI>Plain style: <TT>the_next_event = ok_event;</TT></LI>
<LI>Caps style: <TT>TheNextEvent = OkEvent;</TT></LI>
<LI>Headline style: <TT>The_Next_Event = Ok_Event;</TT></LI>
<LI>Title style: <TT>The_next_event = Ok_event;</TT></LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Personally I prefer the first style, which is why it's the default.</P>

.page Example of Controlling a Telephone

.build anchor rover
<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>This next example is one that a correspondent at a telephone company
proposed. It's a design for a simple but dedicated subprogram (we'll call it
'Rover') that hangs-around on the corner of our telephone central.  Rover
springs into action (presumably woofing and waggling a shaggy tail) when we
pick-up the handset, or when a call comes in for us.  The dialog loops around
and around, each time driven by an 'incoming message'.  This message is one
of these events:
<UL>
<LI><B>Offhook</B> - we picked-up the handset.  Presumably this affects the
current on the line, which the central can detect.</LI>
<LI><B>Onhook</B> - we put the phone down.</LI>
<LI><B>Request</B> - another person is calling us from a 'remote' phone.</LI>
<LI><B>Digit</B> - we pressed a digit on the touchpad.</LI>
<LI><B>Whole Number</B> - we pressed enough digits to form a recognised
number.</LI>
<LI><B>Accept</B> - the remote phone accepted the call - ie. the remote Rover
gets a Request event of its own.</LI>
<LI><B>Busy</B> - the remote phone was busy.</LI>
<LI><B>Reject</B> - the remote phone number was rejected - we made a mistake
with the number, or (if dialing into Britain) the British changed their
dialing prefixes again.</LI>
<LI><B>Answer</B> - finally, contact.  I hope it was worth it.</LI>
<LI><B>Release</B> - the remote phone cut the Talking.  At our end we hear
a tone that signals this.  (This is how my telephone central works.)</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>Here is the dialog.  Rover waits for anything to happen, then leaps:</P>

<PRE>
After-Init:
    (--) Ok                           -&gt; Idle
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Error                        -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>The two possible events at this stage are <TT>Offhook</TT> (coming from
the local phone), and <TT>Request</TT> (from a remote phone).  We call this
state 'Idle'.  Some people get confused at this point, and point out that
Rover is exactly <I>not</I> idle, so why the name.  Why not call the very
first state 'Idle'?  I answer so: the name of a state reflects the state we
were in when the event happened.  Thus, when Rover was idle, the only two
events that could happen were <TT>Offhook</TT> and <TT>Request</TT>.</P>

<PRE>
Idle:
    (--) Offhook                      -&gt; Dialing-First
          + Start-Dial-Tone
          + Reset-Dialed-Number
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Request                      -&gt; Ringing
          + Start-Ringing-Local
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
</PRE>

<P>The next two states show what happens when we dial the first digit. Rover
stops with the dial tone, and slurps up the digits we press, one by one. I
distinguish <TT>Dialing-First</TT> from <TT>Dialing-Next</TT> to ensure that
Rover does a <TT>Stop-Local-Tones</TT> the first time only:</P>

<PRE>
Dialing-First:
    (--) Digit                        -&gt; Dialing-Next
          + Stop-Local-Tones
          + Have-Dialed-Digit
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Whole-Number                 -&gt; Seizing
          + Stop-Local-Tones
          + Send-Outgoing-Request
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Onhook                       -&gt; Idle
          + Stop-Local-Tones
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
</PRE>

<P>Rover doesn't bother handling the <TT>Onhook</TT> event here, since the
<TT>Defaults</TT> state handles it just fine:</P>

<PRE>
Dialing-Next:
    (--) Digit                        -&gt; Dialing-Next
          + Have-Dialed-Digit
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Whole-Number                 -&gt; Seizing
          + Stop-Local-Tones
          + Send-Outgoing-Request
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
</PRE>

<P>Okay, we just tried to 'seize' the remote phone.  This is either accepted
(and the remote phone starts ringing) or rejected for various reasons:</P>

<PRE>
Seizing:
    (--) Accept                       -&gt; Ringing
          + Start-Ringing-Remote
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Busy                         -&gt; Seize-Failed
          + Start-Busy-Tone
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Reject                       -&gt; Seize-Failed
          + Start-Reject-Tone
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message

Seize-Failed:
    (--) Onhook                       -&gt; Idle
          + Stop-Local-Tones
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
</PRE>

<P>The next three states show how Rover handles a ringing phone (at either
end) and the eventual Talking, if any.  I combined the handling for the local
and remote phones into two states; I could also write this more clearly but
verbosely as four states (<TT>Ringing-Local</TT>, <TT>Ringing-Remote</TT>,
<TT>Talking-Local</TT>, <TT>Talking-Remote</TT>).</P>

<PRE>
Ringing:
    !  Events from local phone
    (--) Offhook                      -&gt; Talking
          + Stop-Ringing-Local
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    (--) Onhook                       -&gt; Idle
          + Stop-Ringing-Remote
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    !  Event from remote phone
    (--) Answer                       -&gt; Talking
          + Stop-Ringing-Remote
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message

Talking:
    !  Event from local phone
    (--) Onhook                       -&gt; Idle
          + Send-Outgoing-Release
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
    !  Event from remote phone
    (--) Release                      -&gt; Released
          + Start-Released-Tone
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message

Released:
    (--) Onhook                       -&gt; Idle
          + Stop-Local-Tones
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
</PRE>

<P>The <TT>Defaults</TT> state handles the <TT>Onhook</TT> event in those
states where there is no local tone.  In those states (like
<TT>Released</TT>), Rover silences the local phone, then loops back to the
<TT>Idle</TT> state:</P>

<PRE>
Defaults:
    (--) Onhook                       -&gt; Idle
          + Wait-For-Incoming-Message
</PRE>

Libero, this is what happens:</P>

<P>Libero assumes that I want to make a program called phone.c.  Since this
file does not exist, it creates a skeleton program for me.  This only happens
the first time.  Once the program is created, Libero will add missing pieces
to it, at the end, but will never change it again otherwise.</P>

<P>I get two other files as well, phone.d and phone.i.  These are the data
and interpreter for my dialog.  I need these files to compile phone.c.  Each
time I run Libero, it recreates these two files.  If I was working in another
language, I would get different files, with different extensions.  The
default language is C.  Here is the skeleton program that Libero gave me,
more or less:</P>

</PRE>

<P>I discuss the details of Libero+C programming elsewhere.  Some rules
apply whatever language you use:
<UL>
<LI>Libero creates a program that is ready to compile and run. The dialog
will halt with an error message since we don't supply any events beyond the
initial Ok.</LI>
<LI>There are some standard modules: a main entry point of some kind,
Initialise-The-Program, Get-external-event, and Terminate-The-Program.</LI>
<LI>Libero adds a module stub for each action that you use in your
dialog.</LI>
<LI>The program relies heavily on source-local variables.  I.e. variables
that are global to all functions in the source file, but not visible to other
source files.  This can be disturbing to some people, but is a natural
consequence of the way Libero restructures your program.  It actually works
quite well, as we'll see later.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>The basic C program consists of a number of standard pieces:
<UL>
<LI><TT>Main</TT> - passes control to the Libero generated code.  In some
languages, such as the C program above, it must also copy any arguments into
variables that can be accessed by other modules.</LI>
<LI><TT>Initialise-The-Program</TT> - initial sanity checks, then usually
passes an Ok event to the dialog.  We do this with the line:<BR>
<PRE>the_next_event = ok_event;</PRE></LI>

<LI><TT>Terminate-The-Program</TT> - halts the dialog by passing it a
Terminate event.  Generally this is the last action that the dialog executes,
so it is also a convenient place to shut log files, etc.</LI>
<LI><TT>Get-External-Event</TT> - the dialog calls this implicitly if it
didn't get an event from any of the modules it executed.</LI>
</UL></P>

.page Example of a C/C++ Comment Stripper

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>One of the classic uses for state machines is in scanning and parsing text
- e.g. source programs.  People usually do this with tools like lex and yacc,
or using languages like Awk and Perl that are good at pattern matching.  When
I explain that Libero uses a state-machine model, some people think that I am
asking them to use Libero in place of the honoured tools I just mentioned.
The next example shows why this is not the case.</P>

<P>Here I present a C/C++ comment stripper based on an example by Robert
Martin (who makes a finite-state machine code generator for C++).  In C and
C++, comments are either enclosed between '/*' and '*/', or begin with '//'
until the end of the line.  This program removes all comments from a C or C++
source program, with some checking for errors like an unmatched '/*':</P>

<P>The program works and is easily understood.  However, because the dialog
is really too low-level, it makes the problem seem more complex than it
actually is.  In fact, this is a good example of the kind of problem that I
would never use Libero for.  I would write this as a straight C program.</P>

<P>Moral: Libero is not worth the overhead on trivial problems.  By contrast,
when you are wrestling with a really complex problem, Libero lets you break
it down into smaller, simpler pieces, and keep the central logic in a single
place.</P>

<P>Second moral: simplicity can be deceptive.  It often happens that the
first stab at a problem produces a simple solution, as here.  However, when
the solution meets reality, reality often gets its own way and imposes all
kind of nasty complexities that mess-up the clean solution.  A dialog is very
good at handling such things.  So, it can be better to start-out on the right
footing and use a dialog from the start.</P>

.---------------------------------------------------------------------
.page Example of Parsing An Arithmetic Expression

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P>The next example is for an arithmetic expression evaluator that was
originally proposed by $(*leif=Leif Svalgaard).  The program works out the
value of a string like '2-SQR(2)*1.414'.  The program translates easily into
most of the languages I've worked with so far, from assembler to Basic to C
and COBOL.</P>

<P>Here I describe the program <TT>lrcalc.c</TT>, which is a subroutine that
I use in Libero.  You can find the source for this program along with the
other sources for Libero in the $(*lrsrc.zip) archive.  There are also
versions of this program in various languages in the
$(*expr.zip=examples archive).</P>

<P>Lrcalc chops the expression into tokens, each representing an operand
(numbers) or operator.  The operators are classified as:
<UL>
<LI>term operator: '+' and '-'</LI>
<LI>factor operator: '*' and '/'</LI>
<LI>left-parenthesis: '('</LI>
<LI>right-parenthesis: ')'</LI>
<LI>end-mark: indicates the end of the expression.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P>There are various ways of parsing an expression like this; <TT>lrcalc</TT>
combines two basic techniques: push-down stacks for the operands and
operators, and states to indicate how tokens are handled.  Each state accepts
specific tokens and rejects others. For instance, at the start of the
expression, an operator like '*' is not valid.  When a state accepts an
operand or operator, it adds it to the appropriate stack.  When a state
stacks an operator, it evaluates any previous operators that have the same,
or higher priority.  '*' and '/' have a higher priority than '+' and '-'.</P>

<P>Operators like '(' and ')' are placeholders that group parts of the
expression together with a higher priority.  Operators like '*', '/', '+',
and '-' are binary operators that take two values off the operand stack, do
their work, and place the result back on the stack.</P>

<P>The program basically takes tokens one by one, stacks and evaluates them
according to the priority rules, until it reaches the end of the expression.
To make this clean, the program places a special end-mark token at the end of
the expression when it starts.  When it reaches the end-mark, it evaluates
any remaining operators, which leaves the result of the expression sitting on
the stack.</P>

<PRE>
After-Init:
    (--) Ok                         -&gt; Expecting-Initial
          + Get-Next-Token
    (--) Error                      -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>The two states Expecting-Initial and Expecting-Operand are similar, except
that the first allows End-Mark while the latter does not.  I.e. we accept an
empty expression (End-Mark in Expecting-Initial), but don't accept an
expression that ends when we expect an operand:</P>

<PRE>
Expecting-Initial:
    (--) Term-Op                    -&gt;
          + Allow-Signed-Number
          + Signal-Invalid-Token
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Number                     -&gt; Expecting-Operator
          + Stack-The-Number
          + Get-Next-Token
    (--) Left-Par                   -&gt; Expecting-Operand
          + Stack-The-Operator
          + Get-Next-Token
    (--) End-Mark                   -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>These two states handle signed numbers (e.g.. -12, +100) by accepting
Term-Op tokens (ie. '+' or '-') so long as these are stuck to a following
number.  The module Allow-Signed-Number gets the next token, and if this is a
number, it kicks the dialog into accepting a number in the same state.  It
does this using an exception event called Number:</P>

<PRE>
Expecting-Operand:
    (--) Term-Op                    -&gt;
          + Allow-Signed-Number
          + Signal-Invalid-Token
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Number                     -&gt; Expecting-Operator
          + Stack-The-Number
          + Get-Next-Token
    (--) Left-Par                   -&gt; Expecting-Operand
          + Stack-The-Operator
          + Get-Next-Token
</PRE>

<P>After stacking an operand, the dialog expects an operator:</P>

<PRE>
Expecting-Operator:
    (--) Term-Op                    -&gt; Expecting-Operand
          + Unstack-Ge-Operators
          + Stack-The-Operator
          + Get-Next-Token
    (--) Factor-Op                  -&gt; Expecting-Operand
          + Unstack-Ge-Operators
          + Stack-The-Operator
          + Get-Next-Token
    (--) End-Mark                   -&gt;
          + Unstack-All-Operators
          + Unstack-If-End-Mark
          + Terminate-The-Program
   (--) Right-Par                  -&gt; Expecting-Operator
          + Unstack-All-Operators
          + Unstack-If-Left-Par
          + Get-Next-Token
</PRE>

<P>The Defaults state lists all tokens.  If a state does not explicitly
accept some token, the Defaults state handles it: it issues an error message
and terminates the program:</P>

<PRE>
Defaults:
    (--) Number                     -&gt;
          + Signal-Invalid-Token
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Term-Op                    -&gt;
          + Signal-Invalid-Token
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Factor-Op                  -&gt;
          + Signal-Invalid-Token
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) End-Mark                   -&gt;
          + Signal-Token-Missing
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Left-Par                   -&gt;
          + Signal-Invalid-Token
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Right-Par                  -&gt;
          + Signal-Invalid-Token
          + Terminate-The-Program
    (--) Exception                  -&gt;
          + Terminate-The-Program
</PRE>

<P>The expression parsing technique shown here is easy to elaborate to
support variables, functions, other operators, strings, etc.  It is true that
some languages have easier ways of evaluating expressions, but this technique
is easily applied to languages like assembler and COBOL that do not have
support from tools like lex and yacc.</P>

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<H3>Explain It Like I'm 5 Years Old</H3>

<P>You've gone through all the examples and still you can't
quite get your mind around the concepts?  Don't worry, this is
normal.  It's like anything new -- it takes a while for your
brain to change shape.</P>

<P>So far, we have seen fairly realistic examples - depending on
how much booze was consumed for lunch, admittedly.  Sometimes it
helps to look at the entire issue from other angles.  So, here
is a small piece extracted from our Liberzine
<EM>$(*liberetto=Liberetto I/3)</EM>.  Our correspondent, Big
Al, writes...</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>iMatix asked me to write a small piece on how I learnt to use
Libero. After a short discussion about fees and expenses, I
quickly learnt to use Libero, applying the principle 'imagine I
am a child of 5'.  "No, don't try to interest me in plastic
bunnies.  Explain Libero to me." "Right, kids, get into two
groups.  You lot sit there, and you lot sit there.  Now, we'll
play a game..."</P>

<P>The first group of kids sit around a large playing board,
marked with a large 'START' square, and paths that twist around.
Some end in the Snake Pit, others die horrible deaths in the
Bathtime Room.  Just one path leads through all the dangers to
the Cookie Room.  The aim of the game is to get to the Cookie
Room, of course.  Let's look at the START square.  You are in a
small room.  Twisty passages lead left, right, north, and south.
You are holding a candle.  There is a small breeze coming from
the west.  The floor is blue.  Blue?  Yeah.</P>

<P>The second group of kids have three or four funny dice.  Each
die is a different colour, with size sides.  The blue die says
'Left', 'Right', 'Forwards', 'Backwards', 'Roll Again', and
'Bathtime'.  The red die says 'Fight', 'Run', 'Get Eaten', 'Eat
it', 'Order a taxi', and 'Bathtime'.  (You gotta know how to
*really* scare a five-year old.)</P>

<P>The rules are simple.  The first group of kids just shout a
colour. The second group of kids roll the matching die and -
after puzzling over the letters a while - shout out what the die
says.  Each time the die rolls, the first group move their piece
along the board to a new square.</P>  <P>You start to see the
balance of the game.  Neither group of children controls the
game, it moves step-by-step until the piece wins or loses. The
two groups only communicate by exchanging colours and results.
Well, this is Libero.  Colours are actions, results are events.
And that was the easiest lunch I ever earned.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>A Bit Of Animation</H3>

<P>Sometimes it's hard to mentally connect the dialog to the
running program.  On the one hand you have the dry, pedantic
dialog with its events and states; on the other hand you have a
real live program that is actually <EM>doing</EM> something.  A
good way to join these two concepts is the <TT>-animate</TT>
option.  Use this when you generate code, and you get a display
of the dialog steps a program runs through.</P>

<P>The examples archive has a set of programs that work out the
value of arithmetic expressions.  This is what one of these
looks like as it works out the value of '1 + 1':</P>

<PRE>
After-Init:
    (--) Ok-Event                       We just started
          + Get-Next-Token                so we collect the next token

Expecting-Operand:
    (--) Number-Event                   We got the first '1'
          + Stack-The-Number            Stick it on the operand stack
          + Get-Next-Token                and get the next token

Expecting-Operator:
    (--) Term-Op-Event                  We got the '+'
          + Unstack-Ge-Operators        Do any higher-priority operators
          + Stack-The-Operator            then stick the '+' on the stack
          + Get-Next-Token                and get the next token

Expecting-Operand:
    (--) Number-Event                   We got the second '1'
          + Stack-The-Number            Stick it on the operand stack
          + Get-Next-Token                and get the next token

Expecting-Operator:
    (--) End-Mark-Event                 We hit the end of the expression
          + Unstack-All-Operators       Do all operators on the stack
          + Unstack-If-End-Mark         The operand stack holds the result
2                                       This is displayed by the program

.page Frequently Asked Questions

<H2>$(TITLE)</H2>

<P><EM>Why is the documentation in HTML format?</EM></P>

<P>We originally wrote the documentation using Microsoft Word
5.0 for MS-DOS, a fine word-processor that satisfied our
minimalist preferences for a long time.  Our target was
PostScript on paper.  Since those old days, we have changed our
minds a little about the best way of moving information from our
brains to yours.  We like the idea of keeping the help 'on-line'
in the literal sense.  Effectively, this means using HTML.  Now,
our approach is two-fold.  Firstly, we use HTML as the basic
language.  It's excellent for the job.  Secondly, we have
structured the documentation to suit.  This means that the
Libero documentation is less of a traditional paper book, and
more of a hyper-linked text database. Our guiding principle is
that you can take the entire HTML kit and put it on a local hard
disk, then browse, print, and copy that.  There are HTML
browsers available for all of our target platforms, and the
market is competitive and generally free.</P>

<P><EM>Why do you not supply binary kits for UNIX (any
longer)?</EM></P>

<P>We used to do this...  It just does not work very well, and
takes a lot of work.  It is generally not a good idea to use an
executable built under one version of an operating system on an
other.  Sometimes, but not always, you can go from an earlier
version of <EM>Brandix</EM> to a later version, but never
contrarywise.  With some exceptions (see next question) it's a
snap to install Libero by compiling the source kit.  At iMatix
we tend to do this for all our products today.</P>

<P><EM>I get compile errors on Sun Sparc</EM></P>

<P>For some bizarre reason, possibly related to the struggle of
commercialism over utility, this system does not come with an
ANSI C compiler as standard.  People often install GNU C, which
works well, but there can be conflicts between the Sun header
files and GNU runtime library. In theory we fixed these in
version 2.11 (by changing prelude.h).  If you still get compile
errors, send us a listing and we will see what is wrong.  On
some Sparc systems, the ANSI C compiler is called acc.</P>

<P><EM>I get compile and link errors and then <TT>lr</TT>
dies</EM></P>

<P>If you get compile errors (not warnings), or link errors,
don't try to run the resulting executable.  Or if you do, don't
expect reasonable behaviour, unless one can describe a dump as
'reasonable'.</P>

<P><EM>Does Libero support language </EM>X<EM>?</EM></P>

<P>If it is not on the list, the answer is 'not yet'.  There are
several possible reasons why we have not yet built a schema for
a particular languages:
<UL>
<LI>We hate the language and would not touch it with a 10 ft
pole.</LI>
<LI>We don't have a compiler or interpreter for that language;
</LI>
<LI>We don't consider the language to be worth it;</LI>
<LI>We don't see a good way to implement dialogs in the
language;</LI>
<LI>We have not had time yet.</LI>
</UL>
<P>So far no language has fallen into the first category, while
many have fallen into the last.</P>

<P><EM>How do I add support for language </EM>X<EM>?</EM></P>

<P>If it is a language that we can easily get hold of, we'll add
support more or less on demand.  For instance, if anyone
actually comes and asks for an Ada implementation, we could
install GNU Ada and get an Ada schema up and running in a few
days.  The bizarre thing is we don't even ask for money for the
whole business.  Whatever.</P>

<P>If the language is one that we cannot get freely -- and we're
not in the habit of buying expensive compilers just for fun --
then we can try to build a schema 'by remote control'.  In this
scenario, you provide us with the specifications of the
language, sample programs, etc.  We'll do the schema and send
you programs to test.  Eventually we get a solid version.  This
can work surprisingly well.</P>

<P>Finally, you can bite the bullet (more like a 10mm shell) and
learn how Libero's schema language works.  You can then write
the schema yourself.  Honestly, if you need to write a schema
from scratch, this is probably the hard way.</P>

<P><EM>I want to customise a schema</EM></P>

<P>Firstly, be sure that you can't get what you need by adding
code to the template file.  Then, drop us a line to tell us what
you want so we can try to figure-out a way of supporting it in
the standard schemas. As a last resort, copy the schema and
change it.  If your changes are cosmetic, we'd try to convince
you to accept our cosmetics.  Some projects have such unusual
needs that a new schema is the only practical answer.  Be
warned, however: if you make your own version of a schema, you
lose the benefits of any future improvements or fixes to the
schema.</P>

<P><EM>I don't understand Libero</EM></P>

<P>This is quite normal.  Anyone who understands Libero the
first time is either lying, has a serious mental problem, or is
not a real programmer. The concept is simple, and easy to
explain to a lay-person.  But if you have spent long enough
coercing computers to do your bidding, you get a certain
world-view of how things work.  Libero does things differently.
Keep trying, and after a week or so you will suddenly see it.
</P>

<P><EM>How do I print-out the documentation?</EM></P>

<P>Probably the best approach is to download the
$(*lrfull.zip=big file) that contains the entire documentation
kit.  Load this into your favourite browser and press 'Print'.
Alternatively you can try to convert the HTML file into a word
processor format, load it up and print it like that.  This is a
field that is changing rapidly, for the better.</P>

<P><EM>Why is there no UNIX Makefile?</EM></P>

<P>There are several reasons for this: Libero is a portable
product, and makefiles are specific to UNIX; we don't really
like makefiles; we prefer to try a more 'intelligent' approach
when possible; we don't have the time to make and maintain
makefiles for all the possible UNIX platforms.  Ok, none of
these reasons is enough by itself, but you get the idea.  Libero
is simple to build and install, so the lack of a makefile is not
a serious handicap.</P>

<P><EM>Libero for Windows crashes</EM></P>

<P>There was a bug in previous releases of Libero for Windows.
It was caused by a missing Windows font.  Install the latest
version.</P>

<P><EM>Why can't I get the files by ftp?</EM></P>

<P>Our site does not provide anonymous ftp for reasons of speed
and of security.  If you do not have http access, send us an
e-mail telling us what system you work with, or which files you
want, and we'll send them by e-mail back to you.</P>

<P><EM>Is there a mirror site?</EM></P>

<P>Not to our knowledge, though we have seen a few older
versions of Libero floating around.</P>

<P><EM>How do I build a mirror site?</EM></P>

<P>Our website does not (currently) support anonymous ftp, nor
other protocols for automatic mirror-site replication.  If you
want to set-up a mirror site for Libero, $(*info=contact us) and
we'll work-out the principles.</P>

<P><EM>I want to repackage Libero for a CD-ROM</EM></P>

<P>You do not need our permission, but you must respect our
license terms. If your CD-ROM is for a specific platform, e.g.
Linux, we suggest that you include the binary kit for that
platform, the source kit, and the HTML kit. If you have space on
the CD-ROM, supply the HTML tree uncompressed: then people can
follow the links through their Internet connection to pick-up
other files such as examples.</P>

<P>If your CD-ROM is a source collection, you may want to
provide the Windows version of Libero, the source kit, and the
HTML kit.</P>

<P><EM>Why is </EM>Liberetto<EM> so silly?</EM></P>

<P>Everything is relative.  When the first issue of
<EM>Libermanga</EM> comes out, you'll see what we mean.
Seriously, though, we try to maintain a harmonious balance
between education, entertainment, humour, and subtle irony.
When that fails, we just go for silly.</P>

<P><EM>Is there a 'pretty printer' for my dialogs?</EM></P>

<P>Yes, since version 2.20 - use the -pretty option.</P>

<P><EM>How is a Libero FSM different from a 'classic'
FSM?</EM></P>
<UL>
<LI>Libero lets you specify several actions in a transition; a
classic FSM usually only lets you specify one action.</LI>
<LI>Some FSMs allow an 'entry action', a 'transition action',
and an 'exit action'.  These are all equivalent, as far as we
can see, and since Libero allows multiple actions, you can do
the same in Libero.</LI>
<LI>You describe your FSM as a textual diagram, not as a
numbered graph, as is usually the case.</LI>
<LI>Libero stores the FSM in a table and interprets this.  This
is one of several approaches; some classic FSMs use goto's;
others use a large switch statement.  The table + interpreter
approach is a reasonable compromise between space and speed and
simplicity.</LI>
<LI>Libero has the concept of an <EM>exception event</EM>.</LI>
<LI>Libero has the concepts of <EM>super-states</EM> and
<EM>default</EM> states</EM>.</LI>
</UL>

<P><EM>I want my FSM to handle an event queue in realtime</EM>
</P>

<P>Use our SMT kernel; this is our solution for event-handling
in realtime programs, multi-FSM constructions, communications
servers, internet servers, etc.</P>

<P><EM>Are Libero FSMs good for writing parsers?</EM></P>

<P>Well, in principle yes, but in practice there are better
tools.  For instance, Perl is great for writing ad-hoc parsers.
If you are working with formal grammars, there are tools that
will generate parsers for such grammars.  It is usually
pointless to re-invent the wheel by hand.  There are exceptions.
For instance, sometimes the grammar cannot be formalised enough
to work with a parser generator.  Sometimes a generated parser
is too slow.  In these cases, a Libero FSM may produce excellent
results.</P>

<P><EM>I downloaded a Libero .zip file to my UNIX, then ftp'd
it to my PC - now PKUNZIP won't extract it</EM></P>

<P>When you ftp a binary file like a .zip file, always set ftp
to binary mode (use the command 'bin').  Sometimes ftp is
configured like this by default, but more often it assumes you
want to transfer text files.  So, it expands tabs, converts
line-ending, and such, generally turning a .zip file into
garbage along the way.</P>

<P><EM>Is there a Libero mailing list?</EM></P>
<P>No, not yet.  Each month we send out Liberetto, our fanzine.
We include the most interesting mail we get, news about changes
to Libero, forthcoming releases, etc.  This is the closest thing
to a discussion group so far.  We intend one day to create a
usenet news group.  A public mailing list may be one step on the
way.  We welcome any suggestions.</P>

<P><EM>Libero for Windows complains 'ASSOC.VBX Not Found'</EM>
</P>

<P>To use Libero for Windows you need to download TWO .zip
files; <TT>lrmswin.zip</TT> and <TT>lrmswins.zip</TT>.  The
second contains 'system files' including various .vbx files.  To
download an update you only take the first .zip file. This saves
download time.</P>
