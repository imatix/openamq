Creating a configuration file
=============================

You can also set the above options in an XML text file, to affect
all future instances of the running server. To create a new XML
configuration file, copy the following block to an editor session,
and then:

 1. Delete all options you want to leave as default.
 2. Delete this comment and update your name and the date.
 3. Save file as new xitami.cfg or merge with existing copy.
 4. Restart the server.

Setting server options
===========================

name = "X5":
    Specifies the Server: header field name for HTTP responses. Default
    value is X5.                                                       
port = "80":
    Specifies the port that the server opens for HTTP requests. The       
    standard port for HTTP is 80. If you want to run the server in        
    parallel with other HTTP servers on the same server, choose a server  
    port of 4096 or higher. If you are serving Internet clients, your     
    network may map a public port to the server port number. In that case,
    you may need to specify the public port number separately. Default    
    value is 80.                                                          
public_port = "value":
    Specifies the public port for client requests, if not the standard  
    port number for HTTP (80). The server needs to know this value in   
    order to format accurate redirection responses. Default value is not
    defined.                                                            
trace = "0":
    If set, the HTTP agent displays all socket i/o, which can be useful if
    you need to verify what exactly web clients are sending and getting   
    back from the server. Do not enable this with high loads because you  
    will get enormous amounts of output. Default value is 0.              
animate = "0":
    If set, the HTTP agent displays its activity, which can be useful if
    you need to verify how HTTP requests are being processed. Do not    
    enable this with high loads because you will get enormous amounts of
    output. Default value is 0.                                         
verbose = "0":
    If set, the HTTP agent displays all input and output headers, which  
    can be useful for debugging configuration issues. Default value is 0.
listen = "*":
    Specifies the network interface on which the server should listen for
    connections. By default this is *, meaning all interfaces. You would 
    choose to set an address when you use this application on a box with 
    multiple network interfaces, e.g. routing between two networks.      
    Default value is *.                                                  

Setting host options
===========================

webroot = "webpages":
    Specifies the web root directory. Normally this is used to hold static
    resources - HTML, images, etc. The web root maps to the / URI. Default
    value is webpages.                                                    
defaults = "index.html default.html":
    Specifies a space-delimited list of file names to use as defaults on  
    an empty URI path (the URI refers to a directory name). If none of the
    defaults are present, Xitami will look for a file called .httpdir and 
    if that is present, it will format a directory listing. Default value 
    is index.html default.html.                                           
default_types = ".pdf .html":
    Specifies a list of default document types. The server implements a   
    feature called 'default typing' in which you can specify URIs without 
    file extensions. The default types are specified in order. You can use
    this to publish a URI that specifies an HTML document, for example,   
    and later replace it with a PDF without breaking the published URI.   
    Default value is .pdf .html.                                          

Setting resources options
===========================

monitor = "0":
    Specifies the interval in seconds at which the server will report its
    request/response rates. If zero, no monitoring is shown. The         
    recommended value is 1, if monitoring is desired. Default value is 0.
record_stats = "0":
    Specifies whether or not the server records performance statistics in 
    a format suitable for importing into a spreadsheet. If set, the server
    creates a file called 'http_stats_(portnumber).del' which contains    
    performance statistics in a comma-delimited format. For this setting  
    to take effect, the monitor option must also be set. Default value is 
    0.                                                                    

Setting logging options
===========================

log_path = "/var/log/xitami":
    Specifies the directory into which active log files are placed. To get
    the old behaviour, set this option to 'logs'. Default value is        
    /var/log/xitami.                                                      
keep_logs = "1":
    Specifies whether or not the server should keep logs. If zero, the   
    server will not keep logs. If 1, it will keep an alert log, an access
    log, and a debug log as specified. Default value is 1.               
archive_cmd = "value":
    If specified, this command is run on all archived log files. You can 
    use this option to compress archived log files, or clean up old and  
    unwanted files. When the command is run, the name of the archived log
    file is provided to it as a single argument. Default value is not    
    defined.                                                             
alert_log = "alert.log":
    The name of the alert log file, which records all errors and warnings 
    issued by the server. Note that the server port number is always added
    to the name of the log file. Default value is alert.log.              
access_log = "access.log":
    The name of the access log file, which records all HTTP requests in   
    the specified access log format. Note that the server port number is  
    always added to the name of the log file. Default value is access.log.
access_log_format = "CLFX":
    The format of the access log file, which can be one of: CLF -     
    NCSA/httpd common logging format (basic); CLFX - Apache format; or
    other - custom log file format. Default value is CLFX.            
debug_log = "debug.log":
    The name of the debug log file, which records all normal activity,   
    errors, and debug trace information. Note that the server port number
    is always added to the name of the log file. Default value is        
    debug.log.                                                           
syslog = "0":
    Specifies whether or not to use the syslog protocol for logging. By   
    default log files are written directly to disk. If this option is set 
    to 1, uses the syslog protocol for all log files. Uses a priority     
    depending on the type of log message (LOG_ERROR, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG).
    Uses the LOG_DAEMON facility. Has no effect on Windows. Overrides the 
    keep_logs option. Default value is 0.                                 

Setting security options
===========================

user = "value":
    If you specify a user and group, the server will switch to that user
    and group after opening its port, thus dropping any privileges it   
    previously had. Default value is not defined.                       
group = "value":
    If you specify a user and group, the server will switch to that user
    and group after opening its port, thus dropping any privileges it   
    previously had. Default value is not defined.                       
blacklist = "blacklist.txt":
    Specifies a text file to use for the blacklist. The blacklist is an   
    easy way to blacklist IP addresses of spammers without modifying the  
    main server configuration files. This file contains one IP address per
    line. To disable blacklisting, set the option to a non-existent file  
    or "". Default value is blacklist.txt.                                
basic_auth = "passwd":
    Specifies the file to use for Basic authentication. The file uses the
    Apache htpasswd format, see                                          
    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/password_encryptions.html. The 
    plain text format of each line in this file, if you don't have the   
    htpasswd tool, is '{username}:{password}'. You can mix digest and    
    passwd password entries in a single file. Default value is passwd.   
digest_auth = "digest":
    Specifies the file to use for Digest authentication. The file uses the
    Apache htdigest format, see                                           
    http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/password_encryptions.html.      
    Default value is digest.                                              
password_ttl = "0":
    If set to a non-zero value, passwords will expire this many seconds  
    after they are first loaded into Xitami. You can reset an expired    
    password by editing the password file or setting a new password using
    the Apache htpasswd / htdigest tools. Default value is 0.            
hit_quota = "0":
    If greater than zero, specifies the number of requests that a browser
    can make using the same user id (+ realm, for Digest authentication).
    When this quota is exhausted, the id password expires. You can reset 
    an expired password by editing the password file or setting a new    
    password using the Apache htpasswd / htdigest tools. Default value is
    0.                                                                   
miss_quota = "5":
    If greater than zero, specifies the number of failed requests that a
    browser can make using the same user id (+ realm, for Digest        
    authentication). When this quota is exhausted, the id password      
    expires. You can reset an expired password by editing the password  
    file or setting a new password using the Apache htpasswd / htdigest 
    tools. Default value is 5.                                          
password_guard = "10":
    If greater than zero, specifies the frequency with which Xitami saves 
    password guard data. The password guard ensures that the hit and miss 
    quotas are properly written to disk so that if Xitami is restarted    
    this data is not lost. If set to zero, Xitami will never save password
    guard data. Default value is 10.                                      
policy_trace = "0":
    Specifies whether policy execution is logged or not. Set this option 
    to get a visual trace of policy execution, especially when you write 
    your own policies. Do not use on production servers, it will generate
    vast amounts of output and slow things down. Default value is 0. This
    option can be changed at runtime.                                    
nervosity = "5":
    Specifies the interval in seconds at which the server will reload    
    externally modified security files (blacklist, password, and digest).
    You can reduce this to one second but this will cause latency spikes 
    due to CPU burn and memory churn if you have very large blacklist    
    files. Default value is 5. Minimum value is 1.                       
nonce_ttl = "60":
    This specifies the validity for Digest authentication nonces. Reducing
    this will increase chatter, as browsers need to request new nonces    
    more often, but reduces the opportunity for replay attacks. Default   
    value is 60. Minimum value is 1.                                      
nonce_quota = "25":
    This specifies the number of requests that a browser can make using 
    the same Digest authentication nonce. When this quota is exhausted, 
    the nonce expires. If set to 1, browsers must ask for a new nonce at
    each request. Default value is 25. Minimum value is 1.              
refresh_by = "value":
    If specified, the http_access_refresh module runs this command to   
    refresh expired or unknown passwords. You may use this to tie Xitami
    authentication to external or system authentication systems. See    
    documentation for details. Default value is not defined.            
refresh_log = "password_refresh.log":
    Specifies the log file for the refresh command. All messages produced
    by the refresh command (stdout and stderr) will be appended to this  
    file. Default value is password_refresh.log.                         
address_quota = "5":
    If greater than zero, specifies the number of open connections a    
    client can have. Setting this value to zero allows unlimited        
    connections per address. This setting is used by the DoS module to  
    detect and handle simple attempts to crash the server by overloading
    it with lots of connections. Default value is 5.                    
abort_delay = "5":
    This specifies the number of seconds that the server will wait, when
    shutting a connection due to detected hostile activity. The delay   
    wastes browser time, making attacks less efficient. Default value is
    5.                                                                  

Setting tuning options
===========================

coremark_cycles = "250000":
    Defines the duration of the automatic CoreMark performance test, in  
    event cycles. If 0, no test will be done. Setting this too high will 
    cause the server to burn CPU at startup. A good value is between 100k
    and 1M. Default value is 250000.                                     
header_max = "32000":
    Defines the limit for HTTP headers; the server will accept up to this
    much data. You can increase the limit if you have applications that  
    pass excessive amounts of data as URI arguments, but usually it is   
    recommended to pass large web forms as POST body data. Default value 
    is 32000. Minimum value is 2048. Maximum value is 2097152.           
bucket_max = "128000":
    Defines the limit for content managed as a memory bucket. The HTTP   
    server can handle contents of any size, but if they exceed the bucket
    max they will be spooled to disk, which can be slow. Default value is
    128000. Maximum value is 2097152.                                    
read_timeout = "60":
    Defines the timeout for network reads. If a client does not send data 
    within this time, it is considered dead. If you get unexpected timeout
    errors in the logs, you may want to increase this value. Default value
    is 60.                                                                
write_timeout = "60":
    Defines the timeout for network writes. If a client does not accept
    data within this time, it is considered dead. If you get unexpected
    timeout errors in the logs, you may want to increase this value.   
    Default value is 60.                                               
accept_retry_timeout = "60":
    Defines the amount of time the server will wait before retrying an    
    accept call if the call failed due to running out of file descriptors.
    Default value is 60. Minimum value is 1.                              
tcp_nodelay = "1":
    If this value is 1, socket data is written immediately, which is     
    usually good for latency. If this value is 0, data is buffered until 
    there is a full packet, which is usually good for throughput. Default
    value is 1.                                                          
tcp_rcvbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use  
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 0.  
tcp_sndbuf = "0":
    If this value is greater than zero, all client connections will use  
    the specified value. Note: setting this value is delicate, do not use
    this option unless you know what you are doing. Default value is 0.  
polling_threads = "4":
    On multithreaded builds, defines the number of OS threads dedicated to
    socket polling. Default value is 4.                                   
working_threads = "4":
    On multithreaded builds, defines the number of OS threads dedicated to
    processing, that is, tasks other than socket polling. Default value is
    4.                                                                    

Setting cache options
===========================

etag = "fixed":
    Defines the ETag header value to use for files. If 'fixed', the ETag  
    consists of the file's modified time, size, and inode. If the etag    
    option is 'float', the ETag consists of the file's modified time and  
    size only. This is useful for large deployments where files are served
    from multiple file systems. If the ETag option is set to any other    
    value, no ETag headers will be produced. Default value is fixed.
