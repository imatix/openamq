<!--
    This pal script sends a series of messages to a topic exchange
    and waits for a confirmation from each subscriber that it has
    read the entire series. You should tell this script how many
    subcribers there are (default = 20).

    To use:

        scriptname -M messages -S subscribers

    The -T option causes the server to set-up a number of topics that
    are used for nothing except to load the topic exchange.
