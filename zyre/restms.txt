++ Introduction

+++ Goals

RestMS aims to:

* Map the AMQP architecture to a set of resources that can be identified by URIs.
* Map the AMQP protocol to a set of methods operating on these URIs.
* Define standard representations for these resources where needed.

And in doing to, hopes to:

* Deliver AMQP-interoperable enterprise messaging to web applications.
* Deliver the scalability and simplicity of the RESTful model.
* Be easy to use in any programming language, for any application, on any platform.
* Define a standardized and implementation-independent URI mapping scheme.

This specification is an initial, simple RESTful mapping of AMQP.  It does not claim to be complete, robust, or fast.  Our intention is to demonstrate that RESTful messaging is feasible today.  We also wish to show that a RESTful messaging model - a set of resources clearly identified with URIs and each supporting the appropriate HTTP methods - can be a constructive input into the design of AMQP/1.0.

+++ Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119[((bibcite rfc2119))].

+++ Terminolgy

These terms are introduced by, or have specific meaning, in this specification:

* Domain - a set of resources managed by one RestMS server or virtual host.
* Feed - a destination for messages published by applications.
* Pipe - a source of messages delivered to applications.
* Join - a relationship between a pipe and a feed.
* Message - a package of data consisting of an envelope and zero or more contents.
* Content - an opaque binary payload, with a MIME type and encoding.
* Asynclet - a resource that can be retrieved before it exists, resulting in a long poll.

These important terms are defined in other specifications:

* Resource - a server-held object that can be accessed across the network.
* Exchange (AMQP) - a destination for messages published by applications.
* Queue (AMQP) - a source of messages delivered to applications.
* Binding (AMQP) - a relationship between a queue and an exchange.
* Attribute (XML) - an XML element attribute.  Interchangeable with "property".

These terms are used with less formality:

* Subscriber - an application that receives data matching some requested criteria.
* Publisher - an application that publishes data, usually for subscribers.
* Reader - an application that receives data.
* Writer - an application that publishes data, usually to a reader.
* Service - an application that implements some named service.
* Long poll - a retrieval operation that can wait indefinitely.

++ RESTful messaging

> All REST interactions are stateless. That is, each request contains all of the information necessary for a connector to understand the request, independent of any requests that may have preceded it.[((bibcite rest))]

RestMS is a RESTful messaging service designed for web applications.

+++ Implementation architecture

The RestMS software architecture consists of these components:

* A RestMS //server//, which speaks HTTP or HTTPS at one side, and one or more messaging protocols (such as AMQP) at the other.
* A set of RestMS //client// applications, which use the HTTP protocol to execute RestMS methods, and thus to send and receive messages.
* Zero or more messaging infrastructures, for example an AMQP server connected to a set of AMQP client applications.  This infrastructure is invisible to the RestMS clients, except insofar as it exists as a sink for and a source of interesting messages.

In this document we provide a formal specification for the syntax and semantics of the HTTP conversation carried out between RestMS clients and the RestMS server, with the goal of explaining to developers how to write RestMS client applications, and to implementors how to build conforming RestMS server implementations.

+++ RestMS design overview

RestMS consists of these design aspects, each presented as a section of this specification:

# A generic document syntax.  This section explains how resources are represented as structured documents in both XML and JSON.  While this generic syntax was designed for RestMS, it is reusable in other applications.
# A generic RESTful framework.  This section explains how HTTP methods are used to create, retrieve, modify, and delete server-side resources.  Like the generic document structure, this generic framework is applicable more widely than RestMS.
# The RestMS protocol semantics.  This section explains the specific semantics of RestMS, in terms of the RestMS resources and methods.
# Specifications for AMQP functional interoperability.  This section is intended for RestMS users.
# Specifications for AMQP technical interoperability.  This section is intended for AMQP implementors who wish to support RestMS in their products.
# A guide to HTTP interoperability and security.

+++ RestMS compared to AtomPub

RestMS is inspired by the design of AtomPub[((bibcite atompub))] and that specification may be helpful as a background to the mechanics of implementing a RESTful dialog over a HTTP transport.  The main differences are:

* RestMS provides an event-driven message delivery mechanism (the "asynclet"), while AtomPub requires that applications poll for updates.
* RestMS allows readers to select messages within the server, by creating "pipes" and "joins" to pull specific messages from one or more feeds.  AtomPub delivers all messages in a feed to all readers of the feed.
* RestMS provides a mechanisms for service-oriented architectures in which client applications make requests to remote, loosely coupled services.
* RestMS is designed for high volumes, with message rates of hundreds or thousands per second, while AtomPub is designed for lower message rates.
* AtomPub carries XML messages, while RestMS also supports JSON.  This makes RestMS easier to use in some web applications.

+++ RestMS compared to AMQP

RestMS is inspired by AMQP, and interoperable with it.  However, it has significant differences:

* AMQP is a binary protocol that is complex to read and write, while RestMS uses plain HTTP.
* As a consequence, AMQP applications need specialised API layers, while RestMS applications can use any HTTP library, or plain TCP/IP sockets.
* AMQP is designed for internal network use, while RestMS is based on HTTP and REST and designed for wide-area networks.
* RestMS does not implement consumers, transactions, acknowledgements, but uses a simpler RESTful model for reliable message creation and delivery.
* By using standard HTTP, RestMS traffic is easily monitored, shaped, and throttled.

In terms of pure performance, RestMS can match AMQP performance due to its use of raw binary "stream" pipes.  For most naive uses, however, RestMS is more "chatty" and slower than AMQP.

++ Worked examples

In this section we take two typical examples - a service-oriented network, and a publish-subscribe network - and we implement them in both AMQP and RestMS.  These examples demonstrate how RestMS works by comparison to AMQP, and the examples are useful starting points for real applications.  AMQP and RestMS applications are fully interoperable.

+++ Fortune service example

In this example we show how to implement a service that returns a random message, also called a "fortune cookie".  The fortune service works as follows:

* A client sends a request message to a fortune service.
* The fortune service responds with something witty.

We will first implement the service and client using AMQP methods.  We will then implement the same service and client using low-level RestMS HTTP methods.  We assume the RestMS server is running on port 80 at host.com, and we show only HTTP headers that are relevant to the example.

Here is the message format used by the fortune service.  The request message takes this form (using the RestMS notation):

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message reply_to="{pipe reply-to}" />
</restms>
[[/code]]

And the response message takes this form:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message address="{request reply-to}">
    <header name="fortune" value="{fortune cookie text}" />
  </message>
</restms>
[[/code]]

Note that in this example we are carrying the message data in the message envelope.  This is useful for short text payloads.  RestMS also lets us carry data as separate "contents", which is useful for larger, or binary payloads.

Message routing for this example works as follows:

* Clients send their requests to a service called "fortune"
* The fortune service responds to the reply-to value of the message.
* In both cases, messages are routed via the default feed (or default exchange in AMQP terms).

++++ AMQP fortune service

The fortune service starts by creating a shared queue ("C:" represents a client request, and "S:" represents a server response):

[[code]]
C: Queue.Declare queue="fortune" exclusive="0" auto-delete="1"
S: Queue.Declare-Ok
[[/code]]

It does not need to bind the queue, since it will use the default binding.  It consumes from the queue:

[[code]]
C: Basic.Consume queue="fortune"
S: Basic.Consume-Ok
[[/code]]

Two messages arrive from the server, one from the AMQP client we explain next, and one from the RestMS client we explain later:

[[code]]
S: Basic.Deliver exchange="" routing-key="fortune" reply_to="auto:1023"
S: Basic.Deliver exchange="" routing_key="fortune" reply_to="RESTMS_B4B4"
[[/code]]

The fortune service formats two AMQP messages, setting the headers field 'fortune' to the fortune text it wishes to send.  It then sends the messages to the AMQP server:

[[code]]
C: Basic.Publish exchange="" routing-key="auto:1023"
    headers: { fortune="Never trust an expert with your money, car, or wife" }
C: Basic.Publish exchange="" routing-key="RESTMS_B4B4"
    headers: { fortune="Complexity is the swamp, simplicity the mountain top" }
[[/code]]

++++ AMQP fortune client

The fortune client starts by creating an exclusive server-named queue:

[[code]]
C: Queue.Declare queue="" exclusive="1"
S: Queue.Declare-Ok queue="auto:0123"
[[/code]]

It does not need to bind the queue, since uses the default binding that AMQP provides for all queues, where by the queue name acts as a routing key for messages.  It consumes from the queue:

[[code]]
C: Basic.Consume queue="auto:1023"
S: Basic.Consume-Ok
[[/code]]

The client then sends a request message to the fortune service:

[[code]]
C: Basic.Publish exchange="" routing-key="fortune" reply_to="auto:1023"
[[/code]]

When the message arrives, the server delivers it to the client:

[[code]]
S:Basic.Deliver exchange="" routing_key="fortune"
    headers: { fortune="Never trust an expert with your money, car, or wife" }
[[/code]]

The client unpacks the headers table and takes the "fortune" field, which contains the response from the fortune service.

++++ RestMS fortune service

We now explain how the same service would work using RestMS semantics.  First, the fortune service creates a public feed named "fortune", by posting a feed specification to the default domain:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/domain/
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Slug: fortune

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <feed type="service" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://host.com/restms/feed/fortune

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <feed type="service" />
</restms>
[[/code]]

The fortune service then creates a pipe:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/domain/
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe type="fifo" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://host.com/restms/resource/C4FE

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe type="fifo" reply_to="RESTMS_C4FE">
    <!-- All pipes are automatically joined to the default feed -->
    <join
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/BA5F"
        address="RESTMS_C4FE"
        feed="http://host.com/restms/feed/" />
    <!-- All pipes contain an asynclet for the next message -->
    <message
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/F00D"
        async="1" />
  </pipe>
</restms>
[[/code]]

The fortune service does not expect to be addressed by its reply_to attribute, but rather by the service name "fortune".  It thus creates a join from its pipe to the fortune feed, by POSTing a join specification to the pipe URI.

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/resource/C4FE
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <join address="*" feed="http://host.com/restms/feed/fortune" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://host.com/restms/resource/B33F

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <join address="*" feed="http://host.com/restms/feed/fortune" />
</restms>
[[/code]]

The fortune service then retrieves the message asynclet, and thus waits for an incoming message:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
GET /restms/resource/FOOD
[[/code]]

When a client eventually posts a message to the fortune feed, the RestMS server delivers it to our fortune service, which has been waiting:

[[code]]
Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message
    reply_to="RESTMS_B4B4"
    feed="http://host.com/restms/feed/fortune"
    next="http://host.com/restms/resource/DE55" />
</restms>
[[/code]]

The fortune service then replies with a suitable fortune cookie, by posting a message to the default feed using the reply_to attribute of the request as the address:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/feed/
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message address="RESTMS_B4B4">
    <header
      name="fortune"
      value="Complexity is the swamp, simplicity the mountain top" />
  </message>
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[[/code]]

And the fortune service repeats the process by retrieving the next message asynclet, and thus waiting once more for an incoming message:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
GET /restms/resource/DE55
[[/code]]

When the fortune service decides to end, it deletes its pipe:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
DELETE /restms/resource/C4FE

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[[/code]]

++++ RestMS fortune client

The fortune client creates a pipe by posting a pipe specification document to the default domain:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/domain/
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe type="fifo" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://host.com/restms/resource/B4B4

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe type="fifo" reply_to="RESTMS_B4B4">
    <join
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/00DA"
        address="RESTMS_B4B4"
        feed="http://host.com/restms/feed/" />
    <message
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/C137"
        async="1" />
  </pipe>
</restms>
[[/code]]

The client posts a message to the fortune feed, specifying the reply_to attribute:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/feed/fortune
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message reply_to="RESTMS_B4B4" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[[/code]]

The fortune client then retrieves the message asynclet, and thus waits for an incoming message:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
GET /restms/resource/C137
[[/code]]

And when the fortune service responds, the client gets its reply message from the server:

[[code]]
Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message address="RESTMS_B4B4">
    <header
      name="fortune"
      value="Complexity is the swamp, simplicity the mountain top" />
  </message>
</restms>
[[/code]]

The fortune client then deletes its pipe:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
DELETE /restms/resource/B4B4

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[[/code]]

+++ Newsfeed publish-subscribe example

In this example we show how to implement a topic-based newsfeed service that distributes news articles using a hierarchical categorization structure.  The newsfeed service works as follows:

* A news publisher sends a stream of news covering various categories.
* Clients subscribe to and receive messages from specific news categories.

We will implement a publisher and a subscriber using AMQP methods.  We will then implement the same publisher and subscriber using low-level RestMS HTTP methods.  We assume the RestMS server is running on port 80 at host.com, and we show only HTTP headers that are relevant to the example.

Here is the message format for the newsfeed:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message address="{news category}">
    <header name="title" value="{news item title}" />
    <header name="body" value="{news item body}" />
  </message>
</restms>
[[/code]]

Note that in this example we are carrying the message data in the message envelope.  This is useful for short text payloads.  RestMS also lets us carry data as separate "contents", which is useful for larger, or binary payloads.

As an example we will use this news category tree:

[[code]]
rec
   |
   o- pets
   |  |
   |  o- cats
   |  |
   |  o- dogs
   |
   o- cars
[[/code]]

News categories are written with periods separating each level, like this: "rec.pets.cats".  Subscribers can request specific categories, or use wildcards: '*' specifies any value for one level, '#' specifies any value for any number of levels.

Our sample news stream contains these news items (we show the news category and the item title):

[[code]]
rec.pets.dogs   Montreal: Canine Championship series opens
rec.cars        The oil shock: does it affect you?
rec.pets.dogs   Steroids: the ugly truth from Montreal
rec.pets.cats   Cat vs. dog: facts or fictions?
rec.pets.dogs   Montreal in chaos: winner is a cat!
rec.cars        Red, white, or blue: what it says about you
rec.cars        Parking - who, where, why: a new survey
rec.pets.cats   Superiority: it comes naturally
[[/code]]

You can assume that the order of execution for the publisher and subscriber applications, for the purposes of this example, is:

# Publisher application starts and gets ready to send messages.
# Subscriber application starts and gets ready to receive messages.
# Publisher starts publishing.
# Subscriber receives messages.
# Publisher ends.
# Subscriber ends.

++++ AMQP newsfeed publisher

The news publisher first declares a topic exchange called "newsfeed":

[[code]]
Exchange.Declare exchange="newsfeed" type="topic"
[[/code]]

It then publishes news items to the newsfeed exchange (the news item title is a headers field):

[[code]]
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.dogs"
    headers: { title="Montreal: Canine Championship series opens" }
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.cars"
    headers: { title="The oil shock: does it affect you?" }
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.dogs"
    headers: { title="Steroids: the ugly truth from Montreal" }
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.cats"
    headers: { title="Cat vs. dog: facts or fictions?" }
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.dogs"
    headers: { title="Montreal in chaos: winner is a cat!" }
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.cars"
    headers: { title="Red, white, or blue: what it says about you" }
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.cars"
    headers: { title="Parking - who, where, why: a new survey" }
C:Basic.Publish exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.cats"
    headers: { title="Superiority: it comes naturally" }
[[/code]]

++++ AMQP newsfeed subscriber

Our example news subscriber wants all news in "rec.pets".  It starts by creating a private queue:

[[code]]
C: Queue.Declare queue="" exclusive="1"
S: Queue.Declare-Ok queue="auto:0021"
[[/code]]

It creates a binding for "rec.pets.*" and then consumes from the queue:

[[code]]
C: Queue.Bind queue="auto:0021" exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.*"
S: Queue.Bind-Ok
C: Basic.Consume queue="auto:0021"
S: Basic.Consume-Ok
[[/code]]

The subscriber then waits for messages, and eventually receives these from the server (if the subscriber started //after// the publisher, it would not get any messages):

[[code]]
S:Basic.Deliver exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.dogs"
    headers: { title="Montreal: Canine Championship series opens" }
S:Basic.Deliver exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.dogs"
    headers: { title="Steroids: the ugly truth from Montreal" }
S:Basic.Deliver exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.cats"
    headers: { title="Cat vs. dog: facts or fictions?" }
S:Basic.Deliver exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.dogs"
    headers: { title="Montreal in chaos: winner is a cat!" }
S:Basic.Deliver exchange="newsfeed" routing_key="rec.pets.cats"
    headers: { title="Superiority: it comes naturally" }
[[/code]]

++++ RestMS newsfeed publisher

The news publisher first declares a public topic feed called "newsfeed", by posting a feed specification to the default domain:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/domain/
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Slug: newsfeed

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <feed type="topic" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://host.com/restms/feed/newsfeed

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <feed type="topic" />
</restms>
[[/code]]

It then publishes a batch of news items to the newsfeed feed (for the example, we're not showing the actual news stories, but in reality these would be in the message envelope, or sent as separate contents):

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/feed/newsfeed
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message address="rec.pets.dogs">
    <header name="title" value="Montreal: Canine Championship series opens" />
  </message>
  <message address="rec.cars">
    <header name="title" value="The oil shock: does it affect you?" />
  </message>
  <message address="rec.pets.dogs">
    <header name="title" value="Steroids: the ugly truth from Montreal" />
  </message>
  <message address="rec.pets.cats">
    <header name="title" value="Cat vs. dog: facts or fictions?" />
  </message>
  <message address="rec.pets.dogs">
    <header name="title" value="Montreal in chaos: winner is a cat!" />
  </message>
  <message address="rec.cars">
    <header name="title" value="Red, white, or blue: what it says about you" />
  </message>
  <message address="rec.cars">
    <header name="title" value="Parking - who, where, why: a new survey" />
  </message>
  <message address="rec.pets.cats">
    <header name="title" value="Superiority: it comes naturally" />
  </message>
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
[[/code]]

++++ RestMS newsfeed subscriber

The subscriber creates a pipe on which to receive news items, and the server responds with a pipe description that includes the asynclet on which the subscriber can wait to get the next incoming message:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/domain/
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe type="fifo" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://host.com/restms/resource/F33D

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe type="fifo">
    <message
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/33D1"
        async="1" />
  </pipe>
</restms>
[[/code]]

The subscriber then creates a join from its pipe to the newsfeed, by POSTing a join specification to the pipe URI.

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
POST /restms/resource/F33D
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <join address="rec.pets.*" feed="http://host.com/restms/feed/newsfeed" />
</restms>

Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://host.com/restms/resource/8008

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <join address="rec.pets.*" feed="http://host.com/restms/feed/newsfeed" />
</restms>
[[/code]]

The subscriber retrieves the message asynclet, and thus waits for an incoming message:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------
GET /restms/resource/33D1
[[/code]]

And when a news item arrives, the server sends it to the waiting subscriber:

[[code]]
Server:
-------------------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message address="rec.pets.dogs">
    <header name="title" value="Montreal: Canine Championship series opens" />
  </message>
</restms>
[[/code]]

When the subscriber has finished, it deletes its pipe:

[[code]]
Client:
-------------------------------------------------

++ Generic structured document syntax

+++ Overview

RestMS defines a generic document syntax for resources, based on these principles:

* Resources are typed, and the type names form the main element names in the document.
* A resource may, or may not, be a container for other resources depending on its type.
* The document syntax is fully neutral with respect to the resource hierarchy.  That is, when the protocol is changed to add new resources, remove resources, or modify resources, nothing in this section will change.
* There is a single root resource that contains all other resources.
* Clients can navigate the resource hierarchy with no specific knowledge except the type and URI of the root resource.
* Documents can include opaque binary resources, which themselves cannot contain further RestMS resources.

Our goals with this design are:

* To define a generic syntax that can be implemented, understood, and reused without needing specific knowledge of the RestMS resources and their semantics.
* To define a document syntax that is easily mapped to arbitrary representations including XML and JSON.  We document the use of these two representations but do not exclude others.
* To provide documents that are navigable and discoverable with mimimum prior knowledge.
* To deliver most of the benefits of structured representations (such as cheap parsing) without the cost of formalised validation.
* To allow unilateral extensibility of the resource hierarchy by server implementations.
* To keep things as simple as possible for RestMS users: this means being able to read and create RestMS documents with minimum libraries, extensions, addons, and other complexities.
* To allow for future evolution in structured data representation.

+++ Basic syntax rules

RestMS documents obey these basic rules:

* All RestMS documents have a "document root" element called "restms".
* This document root contains a single "resource root".
* The resource root element contains other elements, each which can itself contain elements.
* All elements except the document root element correspond to RestMS resources, with the name of the element equal to the resource type.
* All elements except the document root may have attributes, corresponding to resource properties.
* All elements except the document root may repeat 0 or more times.

Further, for XML documents:

* The Content-type MUST be "application/restms+xml".
* The document root has a single attribute, xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms".
* The following character MUST be escaped in attribute values:
 * " (escaped by writing &quot;)

And for JSON documents:

* The Content-type MUST be "application/restms+json".
* The following character MUST be escaped in value strings:
 * " (escaped by writing \")

Here is an example of a RestMS document in XML:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <playlist>
    <album
      artist="Echobelly"
      title="On"
      released="1995-10-17"
      summary="Underrated, bittersweet guitar rock perfection">
      <track title="Car Fiction" length="2:31" />
      <track title="King of the Kerb" length="3:59" />
      <track title="Great Things" length="3:31" />
      <track title="Natural Animal" length="3:27" />
      <track title="Go Away" length="2:44" />
      <track title="Pantyhose and Roses" length="3:26" />
      <track title="Something Hot in a Cold Country" length="4:01" />
      <track title="Four Letter Word" length="2:51" />
      <track title="Nobody Like You" length="3:52" />
      <track title="In the Year" length="3:31" />
      <track title="Dark Therapy" length="5:30" />
      <track title="Worms and Angels" length="2:38" />
    </album>
  </playlist>
</restms>
[[/code]]

The resource hierarchy in our example is:

[[code]]
playlist
    |
    o- album
        |
        o- track
[[/code]]

Here is the same document in JSON:

[[code]]
{
"restms": {
  "playlist": [ { "name":"default",
    "album": [ { "artist":"Echobelly", "title":"On", "released":"1995-10-17",
      "track": [
        { "title":"Car Fiction", "length":"2:31" },
        { "title":"King of the Kerb", "length":"3:59" },
        { "title":"Great Things", "length":"3:31" },
        { "title":"Natural Animal", "length":"3:27" },
        { "title":"Go Away", "length":"2:44" },
        { "title":"Pantyhose and Roses", "length":"3:26" },
        { "title":"Something Hot in a Cold Country", "length":"4:01" },
        { "title":"Four Letter Word", "length":"2:51" },
        { "title":"Nobody Like You", "length":"3:52" },
        { "title":"In the Year", "length":"3:31" },
        { "title":"Dark Therapy", "length":"5:30" },
        { "title":"Worms and Angels", "length":"2:38" }
      ],
      "summary":"Underrated, bittersweet guitar rock perfection" }
    ] }
  ] }
}
[[/code]]

+++ Navigation and discovery

RestMS documents use the following rule to allow navigation and discovery:

* The attribute "href", if present, holds the URI for the resource that the element represents.
* The URI for the root resource is known to both client and server by common agreement.
* The URIs for all non-root resources are generated by the server and may be stored by the client.
* URIs may be relative or absolute.

Here is an example of a client retrieving a public playlist resource using a HTTP GET method, with the server's response.  The server is at 'host.com':

[[code]]
Client:
GET /restms/playlist/default HTTP/1.1

Server:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon Jan 12 12:05:01 2009
Content-Length: 440
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <playlist name="default">
    <album
        artist="Echobelly"
        title="On"
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/A1023" />
    <album
        artist="Muse"
        title="Showbiz"
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/A0911" />
    <album
        artist="Toumani Diabate"
        title="Djelika"
        href="http://host.com/restms/resource/A0023" />
  </playlist>
</restms>
[[/code]]

To retrieve a specific album, the client uses the URI provided by the server, for example:

[[code]]
Client:
GET /restms/resource/A1023 HTTP/1.1

Server:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon Jan 12 12:05:02 2009
Content-Length: 1440
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
    <album
        artist="Echobelly"
        title="On"
        released="1995-10-17"
        summary="Underrated, bittersweet guitar rock perfection"
      <track title="Car Fiction" length="2:31"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/1" />
      <track title="King of the Kerb" length="3:59"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/2" />
      <track title="Great Things" length="3:31"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/3" />
      <track title="Natural Animal" length="3:27"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/4" />
      <track title="Go Away" length="2:44"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/5" />
      <track title="Pantyhose and Roses" length="3:26"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/6" />
      <track title="Something Hot in a Cold Country" length="4:01"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/7" />
      <track title="Four Letter Word" length="2:51"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/8" />
      <track title="Nobody Like You" length="3:52"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/9" />
      <track title="In the Year" length="3:31"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/10" />
      <track title="Dark Therapy" length="5:30"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/11" />
      <track title="Worms and Angels" length="2:38"
        href="http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/12" />
    </album>
</restms>
[[/code]]

To retrieve a specific track, the client once again uses the URI provided by the server.  Note that in this case the server delivers a content of type "audio/mpeg-3", which the client should process accordingly (and not as RestMS XML or JSON):

[[code]]
Client:
GET http://music.host.com/resource/A1023/5 HTTP/1.1

Server:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon Jan 12 12:05:03 2009
Content-Length: 2870112
Content-Type: audio/mpeg-3

...opaque binary content...
[[/code]]

++ Generic RESTful framework

RestMS defines a generic framework by which clients issue HTTP methods to work with server-side resources as follows:

* Clients use the GET method to retrieve the representation of a known resource.
* Clients use the POST method to create a new, dynamically named resource.
* Clients use the PUT method to edit a known resource (not to create resources).
* Clients use the DELETE method to remove a known resource.

All methods work orthogonally on all types of RestMS resources, whether those resources contain or do not contain other resources.  Not all combinations of methods and resources are meaningful, implemented, or permitted.

This framework draws heavily on the design of AtomPub[((bibcite atompub))] and that specification may be helpful as a background to the mechanics of implementing a RESTful dialog over a HTTP transport.

In this section we use XML as the document language, but the reader may note that RestMS allows a choice of representations for structured data.

+++ Resource lifecycles and visibility

RestMS distinguishes between resources that are created automatically by the server ("configured resources") and resources that are created at runtime by applications ("dynamic resources").  It also distinguishes between resources that are named and visible to all applications ("public resources") and resources that are unnamed and accessible only by a (by default) secret hash ("private resources").

The lifecycle and visibility of resources is related, as follows:

* Configured resources are always public while dynamic resources are by default private.
* Applications can modify and delete dynamic resources, if they know their URIs, while they may not modify or delete configured resources.
* The URI for a public resource is derived from its type and slug (which may be empty), while the URI for a private resource is provided by the server.
* Public resources are named, and discoverable through navigation of parent resources.  Private resources are unnamed, and undiscoverable through navigation.
* Dynamic resources may in some cases be created by the server.

The URI for a public resource is derived from the resource type and slug as follows:

[[code]]
http://{server-name}[:{port}]/restms/{resource type}/{resource slug}
[[/code]]

The URI for a private resource takes this form:

[[code]]
http://{server-name}[:{port}]/restms/resource/{resource hash}
[[/code]]

+++ Resource propagation

RestMS resources may be propagated to foreign messaging networks (especially AMQP networks).  In this case, these rules apply:

* Public resources are propagated using the resource slug value.  It is responsibility of the client application to ensure that the values used are unique.  Implementations MAY enforce uniqueness, at the cost of interoperability.
* Private resources are propagated using the resource hash value.  It is the responsibility of the implementation to ensure that these hash values are unique.

+++ Creating a new resource

The creation of a new dynamic resource follows these rules:

* The new resource will always be the child of another resource (the 'parent') identified with a URI.
* The client creates the resource by sending a POST method on the parent URI and providing the specifications for the new resource as the POST content body.
* The client can request a public or a private resource.  Public resources are created with a Slug, while private resources are accessible only via the server-generated URI.
* The server replies, if there was no error, with a "200 OK" or "201 Created" reply status, a Location: header that provides a URI to the new resource, and a content body that represents the created resource.

[[code]]
Client                                     Server
  |                                           |
  |  1.) POST to parent URI                   |
  |      Resource specifications              |
  |------------------------------------------>|
  |                                           |
  |  2.) 201 Created                          |
  |      Location: Resource URI               |
  |<------------------------------------------|
  |                                           |
[[/code]]

Note that the content body of a created resource may be different than the content body provided by the client: the client provides specifications for the resource, while the server provides the actual resulting resource contents.

This is the general form of a client request to create a dynamic resource:

[[code]]
POST /{parent uri} HTTP/1.1
Host: {hostname}
User-Agent: {user agent}
Authorization: {credentials}
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Content-Length: {size of content}
Slug: {name for public resource}

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <{resource type}>
    {resource specifications}
  </{resource type}>
</restms>
[[/code]]

If allowed by the resource type, and if the Slug header is specified, the new dynamic resource will be public, otherwise it will be private.  This is the general form of a server response for a created resource:

[[code]]
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: {response date}
Content-Length: {size of content}
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Location: http://{hostname}[{port}]/restms/resource/{hash}
ETag: "{resource entity tag}"

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <{resource type} ...>
    {resource contents}
  </{resource type}>
</restms>
[[/code]]

Private resources can only be accessed through their URI.  If the POST request actually created the resource the server responds with "201 Created".  If the resource already existed and the specifications are identical to the existing resource, the server responds with "200 OK". Otherwise the server responds with a "400 Bad Request".

+++ Retrieving a known resource

Retrieving a known resource follows these rules:

* The client must know the URI of the resource.  If it does not know the URI of the resource, and the resource is public, it can discover this by retrieving the parent resource and examining its contents.  If the resource is private, the client must either have created the resource, or must receive the resource URI by an out-of-band communication (for example a message from an external resource management service application).
* The client retrieves the resource by sending a GET method on the resource URI.
* The client can optionally specify headers to control the caching of the resource both by itself and by proxies that sit between it and the server.  We explain caching below.
* The server either returns a "200 OK" reply with the contents of the resource, or returns a reply code indicating why it did not return the resource contents.

[[code]]
Client                                     Server
  |                                           |
  |  1.) GET to Resource URI                  |
  |------------------------------------------>|
  |                                           |
  |  2.) 200 Ok                               |
  |      Resource representation              |
  |<------------------------------------------|
  |                                           |
[[/code]]

This is the general form of a client request to retrieve a resource:

[[code]]
GET /{resource uri} HTTP/1.1
Host: {hostname}
User-Agent: {user agent}
Authorization: {credentials}
[[/code]]

And this is the general form of a server response:

[[code]]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: {response date}
Content-Length: {size of content}
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
Date-Modified: {resource date and time}
ETag: "{resource entity tag}"

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <{resource type} ...>
    {resource contents}
  </{resource type}>
</restms>
[[/code]]

If the client has previously retrieved the same resource and still has that ETag, it can use the If-None-Match: header, specifying the ETag value, and/or the If-Modified-Since: to do a conditional GET:

[[code]]
GET /{resource uri} HTTP/1.1
...
If-None-Match: "{resource entity tag}"
If-Modified-Since: {resource date and time}
[[/code]]

If the resource has not changed - still has the same ETag and modification date - the server replies with a "304 Not Modified":

[[code]]
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
Date: {response date}
[[/code]]

+++ Modifying a known resource

Modifying a known resource follows these rules:

* The client must know the URI of the resource.  If it does not know the URI of the resource, it can discover this by examining the contents of the parent resource.
* The client must have retrieved the resource using GET.
* The client sends new resource contents by sending a PUT method on the resource URI with a modified resource content.
* The client can optionally specify headers to control potential conflicts (two clients trying to modify the same resource at the same time).
* The server either returns a "2xx OK" reply indicating success, or returns a reply code indicating why it did not modify the resource contents.

[[code]]
Client                                     Server
  |                                           |
  |  1.) GET to Resource URI                  |
  |------------------------------------------>|
  |                                           |
  |  2.) 200 Ok                               |
  |      Resource representation              |
  |<------------------------------------------|
  |                                           |
  |  3.) PUT to Resource URI                  |
  |      Modified resource representation     |
  |------------------------------------------>|
  |                                           |
  |  4.) 200 OK                               |
  |<------------------------------------------|
[[/code]]

This is the general form of a client request to modify a resource:

[[code]]
PUT /{resource uri} HTTP/1.1
Host: {hostname}
User-Agent: {user agent}
Authorization: {credentials}
Content-Length: {size of content}
Content-Type: application/restms+xml

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <{resource type} ...>
    {resource contents}
  </{resource type}>
</restms>
[[/code]]

And this is the general form of a server response:

[[code]]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: {response date}
[[/code]]

The client can use the If-Match: and If-Unmodified-Since headers, specifying the resource's ETag value and last modification date, to do a conditional PUT:

[[code]]
PUT /{resource uri} HTTP/1.1
...
If-Match: "{resource entity tag}"
If-Unmodified-Since: {resource date and time}
[[/code]]

If the resource held by the server has the same ETag and date (and if there are no other errors), the update will continue and the server will reply with "200 OK".  If the resource has changed at the server, and thus has a different ETag and/or date, the server does not update the resource, and replies with a "412 Precondition Failed":

[[code]]
HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
Date: {response date}
[[/code]]

If the PUT request has no content (Content-Length is zero) then the server will respond, if the request was correctly handled, with "201 No Content".

+++ Deleting a known resource

Deleting a known resource follows these rules:

* The client must know the URI of the resource.  If it does not know the URI of the resource, it can discover this by examining the contents of the parent resource.
* The client sends a DELETE method on the resource URI.
* The client can optionally specify headers to control potential conflicts.
* The server either returns a "2xx OK" reply indicating success, or returns a reply code indicating why it did not delete the resource contents.

[[code]]
Client                                     Server
  |                                           |
  |  1.) DELETE to resource URI               |
  |------------------------------------------>|
  |                                           |
  |  2.) 200 OK                               |
  |<------------------------------------------|
  |                                           |
[[/code]]

This is the general form of a client request to delete a resource:

[[code]]
DELETE /{resource uri} HTTP/1.1
Host: {hostname}
User-Agent: {user agent}
Authorization: {credentials}
Content-Type: application/restms+xml
[[/code]]

And this is the general form of a server response when the resource is successfully deleted:

[[code]]
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: {response date}
[[/code]]

If the client previously read the resource, it can can use the If-Match: header, specifying the resource's ETag value, to do a conditional DELETE:

[[code]]
DELETE /{resource uri} HTTP/1.1
...
If-Match: "{resource entity tag}"
[[/code]]

If the resource held by the server has the same ETag (and if there are no other errors), the delete will continue and the server will reply with "200 OK".  If the resource has changed at the server, and thus has a different ETag, the server does not delete the resource, and replies with a "412 Precondition Failed":

[[code]]
HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed
Date: {response date}
[[/code]]

+++ MIME types

When retrieving a document through the GET method a client MAY specify which MIME types it will accept using the Accept header.  While section 14.1 of RFC 2616 (the HTTP specification) defines a sophisticated format for the Accept header, RestMS currently allows these three possibilities:

* Accept: application/restms+xml
* Accept: application/restms+json
* no Accept header, or any other value.

If there is no Accept header, or it is not one of the allowed values, then it is assumed to be "application/restms+xml".

When creating a new resource using the POST method, or when modifying an existing resource using the PUT method, the client SHOULD specify the MIME type of the document that it is sending to the browser, using the Content-Type header.  For RestMS documents this MUST be one of these two:

* Content-Type: application/restms+xml
* Content-Type: application/restms+json

For the DELETE method, neither the Accept nor the Content-Type header have any significance, and if specified by the client, MUST BE ignored by the server.

If a server does not support the structured content type requested or provided by the client, it SHOULD return a response code "501 Not Implemented.

+++ Asynchronous access via asynclets

HTTP is generally a synchronous protocol in which a client polls a server for resources.  This is undesirable in many architectures, both from a design and a performance perspective.  RestMS allows for asynchronous retrieval of resources with the concept of an "asynchronous resource instance", which we call an "asynclet".

A normal resource is identified in a parent resource by a href attribute, and other attributes:

[[code]]
    <some-type href="some-URI" ... />
[[/code]]

An asynclet has the href attribute and a second attribute 'async="1"', telling the client that this resource, though it has a URI, does not in fact yet exist:

[[code]]
    <some-type href="some-URI" async="1" />
[[/code]]

When the client retrieves an asynclet, the server waits until a resource of the right type is created, within that parent, and it then responds to the client with the contents of that new resource.

In those cases where asynclets are meaningful, and implemented, the representation for a parent resource will list all existing resources plus a single asynclet:

[[code]]
    <some-type href="some-URI-1" ... />
    <some-type href="some-URI-2" ... />
    <some-type href="some-URI-3" ... />
    <some-type href="some-URI-4" ... />
    <some-type href="some-URI-5" async="1" />
[[/code]]

When the server returns the document for an asynclet, it always defines an attribute "next" which contains the URI of a new asynclet that represents the next resource which will be created.

At any time, of course, a new resource may 'arrive' and the URI held by a client for an asynclet will then refer to a real existing resource.  This is transparent to the client except that there will be no wait when the client issues a GET on that URI.

The asynclet model gives the client full choice between a synchronous polling dialog (in which it would fetch the parent each time), or an event-driven dialog (in which case it would fetch an asynclet each time).

The asynclet design addresses a similar problem as the Comet "When-Modified-After"[((bibcite comet))] HTTP extension header does, but without extending the HTTP protocol and allowing clients to wait for specific resources within a parent resource context.

+++ Cacheing

RestMS assumes that all resources may be cached.  We define two types of cache.  First, the "end cache", is held in the browser or HTTP client layer.  Second, the "proxy cache" is a service that sits between the client and the server.

The server can allow, or disallow, both types of cache from holding content.  It does this by adding a "Cache-Control: No-cache" header to the response.

The client can inform the server or proxy cache that it has cacheable content for a resource by specifying either one of, or both of, the If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match header.  Usually, specifying both headers will give best results.

Note that if a proxy cache is enabled, clients will not be guaranteed to receive the freshest version of a resource for a GET method.  There is no mechanism to push resource updates to proxy servers.

+++ Idempotency and side-effects

The GET, PUT, and DELETE methods are idempotent: the client can safely issue these more than once.  The POST method is not idempotent and if issued more than once, will create a corresponding number of new resources.

Idempotency allows the client to safely recover from failures where it did not get a response, yet could not sure the server did not receive the request.  For example, any failure in the network, the client, or an intermediary that happens after the server receives the request but before the client receives the response.  The client recovers by simply reissuing any GET, PUT and DELETE requests that were not completed.

The GET method does not modify the state of any resource on the server.

+++ Pipelining

The client may send requests in parallel, which is called "pipelining".  RFC 2616 section 8.1.2.2 says,

> Clients SHOULD NOT pipeline requests using non-idempotent methods or non-idempotent sequences of methods (see section 9.1.2). Otherwise, a premature termination of the transport connection could lead to indeterminate results. A client wishing to send a non-idempotent request SHOULD wait to send that request until it has received the response status for the previous request.

RestMS clients MAY pipeline GET, PUT and DELETE methods, but SHOULD NOT pipeline POST methods.

++ RestMS protocol semantics

+++ Overview of RestMS resources

RestMS resources form a hierarchy in which resources of certain types can contain resources of other types.  In RESTful terms these are also called "collections" and "members".  We prefer a "parent/child" nomenclature since resources can be both collections and members.  This diagram shows the hierachy, and the parent-child relationships between resources:

[[code]]
Resource type           Visibility          Lifecycle
----------------        ----------------    ----------------
Domain                  Public              Configured
  |
  o- Feed               Public, private     Configured, dynamic
  |
  o- Pipe               Private             Dynamic
     |
     o- Join            Private             Dynamic
     |
     o- Message         Private             Dynamic
        |
        o- Content      Private             Dynamic
[[/code]]

* The domain is a collection of feeds and pipes and the child resources they contain.
* A feed represents a first-in, first-out stream of messages received from one or more writers.
* A join represents a relationship between a feed and a pipe.
* A message is the unit of data carried across a RestMS network.
* A content is an opaque binary blob with a content type set by the writer.

The RestMS resources deliver a loosely-coupled architecture that is comparable to and compatible with AMQP but works in a RESTful manner.  The architecture can be drawn in several ways.  This diagram shows the logical flow of a message from writer to reader (both being RestMS client applications) via the different RestMS resources:

[[code]]
.--------.
| Writer |      The writer POSTs a message to a feed.
`--------'      Many writers can post to many feeds.
    ||
    \/
.--------.
|  Feed  |      The feed routes the message to the
`--------'      set of joins attached to it.
    ||
    \/
.--------.
|  Join  |      Each join tells a feed "route this
`--------'      set of messages into my pipe".
    ||
    \/
.--------.
|  Pipe  |      The pipe holds messages on behalf of
`--------'      the recipient, in a FIFO queue.
    ||
    \/
.--------.
| Reader |      The reader retrieves, processes, and
`--------'      deletes messages from the pipe.
[[/code]]

Joins create the loose coupling between writers and readers.  A join is a relationship between a pipe and a feed, and the join's properties tell the feed what messages the pipe needs.

+++ Common messaging patterns

We will look at common messaging patterns that form the basis of most real life use cases.  These patterns are:

* Several writer sends a message to one feed and one reader (the "request" pattern).
* Several joins collect messages from multiple feeds into a single pipe (the "collect" pattern).
* Several joins distribute messages from one feed to many pipes (the "fanout" pattern).

++++ The request pattern

Here is how the request pattern works:

* We have a number of writers, who all write to a single feed
* The reader has a pipe and creates a join to the feed
* As the feed receives messages it will pass them to the pipe
* The pipe collects these messages in a FIFO queue and the reader then fetches them

[[code]]
.--------.      .--------.      .--------.
| Writer |      | Writer |      | Writer |
`--------'      `--------'      `--------'
    ||              ||              ||
    `===============++==============='
                    \/
                .--------.
                |  Feed  |
                `--------'
                    ||
                    \/
                .--------.
                |  Join  |
                `--------'
                    ||
                    \/
                .--------.
                |  Pipe  |
                `--------'
                    ||
                    \/
                .--------.
                | Reader |
                `--------'
[[/code]]

The request pattern is typically used for a simple service where the feed is the "service".  Requestors send their messages to the feed, without needing to know the details of the reader.  We often see this pattern extended with the fanout pattern so that messages are distributed among multiple servicing readers.

++++ The collect pattern

Here is how the collect pattern works:

* We have a number of writers, each writing to one or more feeds
* The reader has a pipe, and creates a join to each feed that it wants to collect messages from
* As each feed receives messages it will pass to the pipe those messages selected by the join
* The pipe collects these messages in a FIFO queue and the reader then fetches them

[[code]]

                | Reader |
                `--------'
[[/code]]

++++ The fanout pattern

Here is how the fanout pattern works:

* A writer publishes messages to a feed
* Many readers each create a pipe and join that pipe to the feed using their selection criteria
* As the feed receives messages from the writer, it distributes them to the pipes, according to the joins
* Each pipe then delivers the messages in FIFO fashion to its reader

[[code]]

| Reader |      | Reader |      | Reader |
`--------'      `--------'      `--------'
[[/code]]

Different types of feed will route messages in different ways.  For some feed types, messages are routed exclusively to one pipe or another.  For other feed types, messages are copied to each pipe that requests them.  We explain feed types later.

+++ Integration with AMQP networks

RestMS is designed to be able to interoperate with AMQP.  This happens as follows:

* RestMS implementations MAY be fully stand-alone, or may implement a federation model.
* If a RestMS server is federated with an AMQP server, a RestMS domain maps to an AMQP network.  The actual mapping of a domain to an AMQP network (defined as an AMQP server and connection credentials) is a configuration issue.
* A feed may map to an AMQP exchange or shared queue, depending on the feed type.
* A message posted by a RestMS application to a mapped feed will be sent to the AMQP server where it can be accessed by AMQP applications via the AMQP mechanims of bindings and queues.
* A message posted by an AMQP application to a mapped feed will be sent to the RestMS server where it can be accessed by RestMS application via the RestMS mechanisms of joins and pipes.

+++ Domains

The domain is a public collection of feeds and pipes and the child resources they contain.  The server MAY implement multiple domains and MAY allow routing of messages between domains.  Domains are configured resources: applications do not create or destroy domains.  A typical use for domains is to segregate different back-end networks (for example, "test" and "production").  Domains thus act as namespaces for pipes and feeds.  The RestMS client and server agree in advance on the domains that exist, and their names.

The URI for a domain is:

[[code]]
http://{server-name}[:{port}]/restms/domain/{domain-name}
[[/code]]

RestMS servers SHOULD implement a unnamed "default domain". The URI for the default domain is:

[[code]]
http://{server-name}[:{port}]/restms/domain/
[[/code]]

These methods are allowed on a domain URI:

* GET - retrieves the domain representation.  This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.
* POST - creates a new feed or pipe within the domain.  The two forms of this method are explained in the descriptions of feeds and pipes respectively.

A domain document specifies the domain properties, and has references to all public feeds and pipes that the domain contains.  The XML format of this document is:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <domain title="{domain description}">
    [ <feed
        title="{feed description}"
        type="{feed type}"
        license="{license}"
        href="{feed URI}" /> ] ...
    [ <pipe
        title="{pipe description}"
        type="{pipe type}"
        href="{pipe URI}" /> ] ...
  </domain>
</restms>
[[/code]]

The domain document does not necessarily list all feeds and pipes: applications may create these as private and thus make them inaccessible through discovery.

+++ Feeds

A feed represents a //write-only// first-in, first-out stream of messages received from one or more writers.  The messages in a feed are ordered, though this order is stable only for messages from a single writer.  In other words, there are no guarantees of ordering between messages from different writers.  Feeds may store messages for arbitrary durations.  Feeds deliver messages into pipes, according to the set of joins defined on the feed.  The RestMS server may provide configured feeds, and applications can create and destroy dynamic feeds for their own use.

These methods are allowed on a feed URI:

* GET - retrieves the feed. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.
* PUT - updates the feed. This method conforms to the generic model.  The feed name and type cannot be modified.
* DELETE - deletes the feed. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.
* POST - sends a message to the feed or stage a content on the feed. We explain these in the description of messages.

The XML specification provided by the client when creating a new feed has this format:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <feed
    [ type="{feed type}" ]                  default is "topic"
    [ title="{short title}" ]               optional title
    [ license="{license name}" ]            optional license name
    />
</restms>
[[/code]]

The XML description of a feed returned by the server has this format:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <feed
      type="{feed type}"                    actual feed type
    [ title="{short title}" ]               title, if specified
    [ license="{license name}" ]            license, if specified
    />
</restms>
[[/code]]

To create a new feed the client POSTs a feed document to the domain's URI.  Dynamic feeds may be named or unnamed.  If unnamed, the feed is accessible only to applications that have learned its URI by some out-of-band mechanism.  All feeds will be propagated to the AMQP network.  A feed maps to an AMQP exchange or shared queue.  The AMQP exchange or queue names can be derived by convention from the feed URI, as previously explained in the section "Resource propagation".

The RestMS server also provides a configured "default feed" with no name, and type "direct" that acts as the routing point for service requests and responses.  This feed maps directly to the AMQP "default exchange" and routes on a literal address string.

The feed type defines the routing semantics of the feed, for example whether it uses literal or wild-card address pattern tests, whether it distributes or fans-out messages, and so on.  RestMS defines a set of standard feed types, and implementations can extend this set. If the client attempts to create a feed with an unknown type, the server responds with "400 Bad Request".  If the client does not specify a feed type, the type defaults to "topic".

+++ Pipes

A pipe represents a //read-only// first-in, first-out stream of messages destined for one or more readers.  The messages in a pipe are ordered, though this order is stable only for messages received from one feed.  Pipes receive messages from feeds according to the joins defined between the pipe and the feed.  They store messages for an arbitrary time.  They deliver messages to a single client.  All pipes are dynamic and always private.

These methods are allowed on a pipe URI:

* GET - retrieves the pipe representation. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.
* DELETE - deletes the pipe. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.
* POST - creates a new join for the pipe. This method is explained in the description of joins.

The XML specification provided by the client when creating a new pipe has this format:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe
    [ type="{pipe type}" ]                  default is "fifo"
    [ title="{short title}" ]               optional title
    />
</restms>
[[/code]]

The XML description of a pipe returned by the server has this format:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <pipe
      type="{pipe type}"                    actual pipe type
      reply_to="{pipe address}"             pipe reply_to address
    [ title="{short title}" ]               title, if specified
    >
    [ <join href="{join URI}" address="{address pattern}" feed="{feed URI}" /> ] ...
    [ <message href="{message URI}" address="{address literal}" /> ] ...
    [ <message href="{message URI}" async="1" /> ]
  </pipe>
</restms>
[[/code]]

To create a new pipe the client POSTs a pipe document, with no join or message elements, to the domain's URI.  Pipes are never named and SHOULD only be accessed by the single application that created them.  The reply_to attribute is generated by the server (and ignored when creating pipes), and clients should use this as the reply_to attribute for messages to which they expect a reply.  Note that every pipe has a default join using the reply_to attribute as address, see below.  All pipes are propagated to the AMQP network.

If more than one application accesses the same pipe, the results will be unpredictable and none of the applications will receive the full set of messages, nor any cleanly defined subset.  The proper way of distributing messages between applications is to create one pipe per application and join all the pipes to the feed.

The pipe type defines the distribution semantics of the pipe, for example whether it delivers one message at a time, or a stream of messages.  RestMS defines a set of standard pipe types, and implementations can extend this set.  An attempt to create a pipe with an unknown type results in a "501 Not Implemented" response.

Applications should create pipes with care.  This is especially important when working with service and rotator feeds.  If an application creates a new pipe each time it starts, messages can be left unprocessed (and thus lost) in unused pipes.  Applications should therefore record the URI of the pipe they are using, and attempt to use this pipe when re-starting.  If the pipe no longer exists, they should create a new pipe and record that.

If applications fail to delete messages from a pipe, each retrieval will return the same message.  Any loop that fetches messages should always do a DELETE for each successful GET.

+++ Joins

A join represents a relationship between a feed and a pipe.  The relationship specifies which messages the pipe is interested in.  We say that a join is "registered" with a feed and that a feed "routes a message to a join".  In the current design of RestMS, for compatibility with AMQP, the routing semantics are specified in the feed type rather than in the join.  Joins are always dynamic and always private and accessible only to applications that know the pipe URI.  If either the feed or the pipe for a join is deleted, the join is automatically deleted.

These methods are allowed on a join URI:

* GET - retrieves the join representation. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.
* DELETE - deletes the join. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.

The XML specification provided by the client when creating a new join has this format:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <join
    address="{address pattern}"             depends on feed type
    feed="{feed URI}"                       the feed to pull from
    />
</restms>
[[/code]]

The XML description of a join returned by the server has the same format.

To create a new join the client POSTs a join document to the pipe's URI.  Joins are never named.  The meaning and function of the address pattern depends on the feed type.

Every pipe automatically has a join on the default feed, using the pipe's reply_to attribute as address.  This provides the same utility as default bindings in AMQP: it reduces the work that a client must do to prepare a pipe for the common use case of receiving a specifically addressed message.

+++ Messages

A message is a document that carries zero or more contents.  The message can be considered the envelope.  It has properties that let the reader decide whether or not to retrieve the content itself.  Messages are always private, dynamic, and created by the server.  The methods allowed on a message URI are:

* GET - retrieves the message representation. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.
* DELETE - deletes the message and all older messages from the pipe. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.

A message document specifies the message properties, particularly the message address, and has resource references to any contents that the message may contain.  The XML format of this document is:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message
    [ address="{address literal}" ]
    [ reply_to="{address literal}" ]
    [ feed="{originating feed URI}" ]
    [ next="next asynclet" ] ... >
    [ <header name="{header name}" value="{header value}" /> ] ...
    [ <content href="{content URI}" ... /> ] ...
  </message> ...
</restms>
[[/code]]

Creating a message does not follow the generic POST semantics, for several reasons.  While messages are created as childred of feeds, they are retrieved as children of pipes.  Feeds are write-only, and pipes are read-only.  That means that when an application creates a new message, it //cannot// retrieve the message and modify it.

The second difference is that messages are constructs, consisting of the message resource itself, plus zero or more opaque binary content blobs.

Finally, RestMS allows batching of messages, so that many can be posted in a single POST request.

To create a new message a client does this:

* It POSTs zero or more binary contents to the feeds's URI.  These contents are staged on the server.  The server returns a Location: header for each posted content.
* It POSTs a single message document, with a content element for each posted content, to the feed's URI.  This message, plus the contents, if any, are then dispatched using whatever routing semantics the feed implements.
* The server replies, if there was no error, with a "200 OK" reply status.  It does not return a Location: header, nor a content body.

For example:

[[code]]
Client                                                           Server
  |                                                                 |
  |  1.) POST to feed URI                                           |
  |      Content-Type: application/octet-stream;type=content        |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------->|
  |                                                                 |
  |  2.) POST to feed URI                                           |
  |      Content-Type: application/restms+xml                       |
  |---------------------------------------------------------------->|
  |                                                                 |
  |  2.) 200 OK                                                     |
  |<----------------------------------------------------------------|
  |                                                                 |
[[/code]]

To create a batch of new messages a client does this:

* It POSTs a single document containing multiple message elements, and no content elements, to the feed's URI.  This message are then dispatched individually using whatever routing semantics the feed implements.
* The server replies, if there was no error, with a "200 OK" reply status.  It does not return a Location: header, nor a content body.

+++ Contents

A content is an opaque binary blob with a content type set by the writer.

These methods are allowed on a content URI:

* GET - retrieve the content. This method conforms to the generic model and we do not explain it further.

++ AMQP functional interoperability

RestMS deliberately invents new nomenclature but for those familiar with AMQP, a feed corresponds to an exchange and/or shared queue, an address corresponds to a routing key, a pipe is analogous to a private queue, and a join to an AMQP binding.  If it helps to understand RestMS, these are the main shifts that RestMS makes from the AMQP/0.9.1 semantic model:

* Shared queues are merged into exchanges, and the resulting entity is renamed "feed".  In AMQP, exchanges have no state, while shared queues cannot do routing.  In RestMS, feeds have both state and capacity to route messages.
* The exclusive queue concept are renamed to "pipe" and moved closer to the client edge.
* The binding / routing key concepts are merged into a new concept called "address", which is used both for publishing messages and for joining pipes to feeds.

In this section we look at the interoperability of messaging applications, i.e. how RestMS applications can talk, transparently, to AMQP applications, and vice-versa.  The main issues we must address are:

* How the different feed and pipe types map to AMQP exchanges, queues, and bindings.
* How we ensure that messages are semantically compatible with both protocols.
* How we route messages correctly between RestMS and AMQP applications.

+++ RestMS feed types

Implementations SHOULD implement all of these feed types and MAY implement others:

* The **fanout** feed type routes a copy of an incoming message to each join registered with the feed.  The join address and message address are not used during routing.  Joins made to a fanout feed should always have the address "*".

* The **direct** feed type routes a copy of an incoming message to each join registered with the feed that has an address pattern that is identical to the message address.  The default feed (with URI path "/restms/feed/") is a direct feed.

* The **topic** feed type routes a copy of an incoming message to each join registered with the feed that has an address pattern that matches the message address following AMQP's topic matching rules.

* The **headers** feed type routes a copy of an incoming message to each join registered with the feed that has an address pattern that matches the message address following AMQP's header matching rules.

* The **system** feed type routes incoming messages to internal services, according to the routing key.

* The **rotator** feed type routes a message to exactly one join, using a round-robin algorithm to select the join.  An application can increase its proportion of the messages received by creating multiple joins to the feed.  The feed does not use the join address pattern or message address literal.  Joins made to a rotator feed should always have the address "*".

* The **service** feed type works as the rotator feed, but has the additional property of self-deleting when the the number of joins registered on it drops from 1 to zero.  This means that the presence or absence of the feed indicates the availability of the "service" it represents. Joins made to a service feed should always have the address "*".

A //fanout//, //direct//, //topic//, //headers// or //system// feed maps to an AMQP exchange of the same type.  In general terms these feeds route by doing some kind of matching between the address attribute of a message (a literal string), and the address attribute of a join (a pattern).  If the feed is private, a hashed name is used for the exchange so that it cannot be discovered by AMQP applications, otherwise the feed name is used as the exchange name.  When a RestMS client posts a message to the feed, the RestMS server publishes this message to the corresponding exchange, using as routing-key the //address// attribute of the message envelope.

A //rotator// or //service// feed maps to an AMQP shared queue.  These feeds route by distributing messages to pipes on a round-robin basis.  If the feed is private, a hashed name is used for the queue so that it cannot be discovered by AMQP applications, otherwise the feed name is used as the queue name.  When a RestMS client posts a message to the feed, the server publishes this to the default exchange, using as routing-key the feed name.  If there is an address specified in the message envelope, this is used as the message-id, unless a message-id is also specified, in which case the address is discarded.

+++ Standard pipe types

Implementations SHOULD implement the fifo pipe type, and MAY implement any of the other pipe types.  If they do implement them, they must conform to the semantics defined here.

Pipes are propagated to the AMQP network as bindings that use the "reply_to" attribute of the pipe (this pipe attribute is automatically set by the RestMS server on new pipes).  Pipes MAY be implemented as private queues on the AMQP server but this is not the only architecture.

* The **fifo** pipe type holds an unspecified (but greater than one) number of messages and delivers these to a client application when asked for them.  It delivers messages one by one and messages remain in the pipe until deleted.

* The **stream** pipe type delivers messages as multipart contents so that a single GET will retrieve an unending stream of message contents.  This needs to be fully defined.

* The **ondemand** pipe type does not fetch a message from the feed until the pipe requests it through an asynclet.  This is designed to prevent messages being "lost" in unused or abandoned pipes, and is meant primarily to be used with service and rotator feeds.

+++ Message semantics

An AMQP message consists of a set of envelopes and an opaque binary payload. There are four AMQP envelopes, though in AMQP/0.9.1 the distinction is not clearly made, and there are overlaps:

# An envelope used for routing inside the AMQP server (exchange, routing-key, headers)
# An envelope used to define the quality of service for deliveries to a recipient (delivery-mode, priority)
# An envelope used to communicate between client APIs.(headers, reply-to, correlation-id, expiration, message-id)
# An envelope used to communicate between client applications.(content-type, timestamp, type, user-id, app-id, sender-id)

In AMQP the envelopes are partially encoded as arguments for commands (the Basic.Publish and Basic.Deliver commands) and partially as properties of messages.

In RestMS, the message envelope and message content are split into two distinct resources.  The RestMS Content-Type and Content-Encoding headers map directly to/from the AMQP content-type and content-encoding properties.  The routing-key is either the address, or the feed name, depending on the type of feed.  The remaining envelope properties are encoded as follows:

[[code]]
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<restms xmlns="http://www.imatix.com/schema/restms">
  <message address="{address literal}"
    [ delivery_mode = "{delivery-mode}" ]
    [ priority = "{priority}" ]
    [ correlation_id = "{correlation-id}" ]
    [ reply_to = "{reply-to}" ]
    [ expiration = "{expiration}" ]
    [ message_id = "{message-id}" ]
    [ timestamp = "{timestamp}" ]
    [ type = "{time}" ]
    [ user_id = "{user-id}" ]
    [ app_id = "{app-id}" ]
    [ sender_id = "{sender-id}" ]
    >
    [ <header name="{header name}" value="{header value}" /> ] ...
  </message>
</restms>
[[/code]]

+++ RestMS to AMQP application routing

AMQP requires, as a working basis, that application agree in advance on the routing model they will use to exchange messages.  Typically, this takes the form of contracts based on the name and type of an exchange, and the allowed values for routing keys used in bindings and messages.  To assure routing between RestMS and AMQP applications we need similar conventions.

We can break the diversity of service-oriented messaging down into three component scenarios, each of which needs rules for interoperability between RestMS and AMQP applications:

# In which a request is sent to a remote "service", implemented by one or more service applications.
* In which the response to a service request is sent back to the original requesting application.
* In which a publisher distributes data to multiple subscribers.

These conventions apply:

* A service MUST correspond to a shared queue in AMQP terms, or a service or rotator feed in RestMS terms.  AMQP service applications MUST consume from the shared queue.  RestMS service applications MUST create a pipe and create a join from the pipe to the feed.  A service MAY be implemented transparently by any mix of AMQP and RestMS applications, with messages being served in a round-robin fashion to each implementing application.

* A request message that needs a reply MUST provide a reply_to attribute.  For AMQP clients this MUST be the name of a private response queue. For RestMS clients this MUST be the reply_to attribute of a pipe.

* Services that wish to send replies MUST use the reply_to attribute of the request message.  If they are AMQP service applications, they MUST publish the reply to the default exchange using the reply_to attribute as routing key.  If they are RestMS service applications, they MUST post the reply to the default feed using the reply_to attribute as address.

* For data distribution, a RestMS fanout, topic, or headers exchange maps to an AMQP exchange, and subscribers can be either RestMS clients or AMQP clients.  RestMS clients create pipes and join them to the feeds they want to consume from, specifying the address pattern in each case.  AMQP clients create private queues and bind them to the exchanges they want to consume from, specifying the routing key in each case.

++ AMQP technical interoperability

We look at the interoperability of the messaging products, i.e. how to connect a RestMS server to an AMQP server or network.  The main issues we must address are:

* Whether the AMQP server supports the necessary RestMS semantics
* How the RestMS server mirrors resources to and from the AMQP server
* How the RestMS server routes messages to and from the AMQP server

+++ The RestMS extension class

In order to interoperate with a RestMS server, an AMQP server must be able to accept and exchange resource definitions. Thus, if a RestMS client creates a feed, the same feed should be created on the AMQP server, so that AMQP applications have access to it.

There are some significant differences between the RESTful model we implement in RestMS, and the AMQP model for resource management.  It would be possible, in theory and in time, to modify the AMQP protocol to become compatible with RestMS.  For example, commands like Queue.Delete would need to become idempotent so that attempting to delete a non-existent queue was safe.  Today, AMQP treats such attempts as fatal errors.

Rather than attempt to modify existing AMQP semantics, we define an AMQP "extension class", an extension mechanism that AMQP allows.  The advantage of an extension class is that a RestMS server can detect immediately whether its target AMQP server supports it, or not.  There is no ambiguity.  This class uses index 61501, which falls into the space allotted for extension classes.

  RestMS resource management class.

    Provides methods to work with server-side resources as defined by
    the RestMS specification.  All methods are request-only, without
    response.  Errors are logged at the server side and not reported
    to the client.  This model is designed to allow a RestMS server to
    push state to the AMQP server, rapidly and without handshaking.
    In future versions we may allow for asynchronous error reporting
    back to the RestMS server, probably via an AMQP exchange.

+++ Resource synchronisation

The RestMS extension class defined above provides a clean way for the RestMS server to synchronize all its resources with an AMQP server, and vice-versa.  Since the commands are asynchronous and not confirmed, they can be executed very rapidly, so that one server can synchronize its resources on another (for example, after failover) at the rate of tens of thousands of resources per second.

To avoid "storms", a server should track the origin of resources, and synchronise only those which were created by its own local clients.

When a server receives resource specifications from another server, these resources SHOULD be treated as configured and clients SHOULD not be allowed to delete them except on the original server.

Server implementations MAY take any reasonable approach to resources that are "orphaned", i.e. where their original owning server has disconnected and/or gone off line.

+++ Message routing

RestMS does not impose a specific architecture for interconnection with an AMQP network and there are several possibilities which we explain for the benefit of implementors.

In practice, AMQP servers may be paired for high-availability, and/or may be federated themselves into larger AMQP networks.  In this discussion we will assume that the RestMS server speaks to exactly one AMQP server.

The first model relies on the AMQP server to do all routing.  In this case, the RestMS server will synchronise all feeds, pipes, and joins with the AMQP server.  All RestMS pipes and joins are instantiated as private queues and bindings on the AMQP server.  Pipes are implemented in the simplest fashion: each pipe has an exclusive queue with the same name, with a consumer with tag x:{pipe-name}.  When the RestMS server creates joins on the pipe, these are implemented as bindings that bring messages into the private queue.  This is for exchange-based feeds.  For queue-based feeds, the pipe is implemented as a consumer on the shared queue, with tag q:{pipe-name}.  These distinct tags are used by the RestMS server to route messages coming from the AMQP server into separate pipes for end-application delivery.

When a RestMS client posts a message to a feed, the RestMS server forwards that message to the AMQP server.  When an AMQP client publishes a message, this also arrives on the AMQP server.  The AMQP server then routes that to all matching bindings, and thus into private queues.  Message are then delivered to the RestMS server, which uses the consumer tag to sort the messages into their pipes.  RestMS clients can then retrieve their messages from their pipes.

A second model is to open multiple connections or channels, e.g. one per pipe, and to use these to segment messages per pipes.

The advantage of these two model is that they are easy to understand and implement.  The main disadvantage is that messages will be sent redundantly, if they match multiple joins/bindings.  This will waste LAN bandwidth.

The optimal, but most complex model, is to use federation-style normalization.  In this model, the RestMS server maintains its own routing data structures, and forwards binding requests to the AMQP server.  When messages arrive, they are routed not on consumer tag, but according to the message routing key and/or other properties.  This model demands that the RestMS implementation has the same routing capabilities as the AMQP server, i.e. implements exchanges and shared queues in much the same way.  The advantage of this model is that it allows for stand-alone RestMS operation, and is the optimal design for RestMS-to-RestMS interoperation (with no extra hops to and from the AMQP server).

Finally, a RestMS server does not need to work with an AMQP network, it can be self-standing.
